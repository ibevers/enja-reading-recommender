――I had been drinking alcohol that I couldn't drink since the last time, in order to deceive my weak heart.
Broadcast music "Radio Myusic" that depicts the third harmonic "Third Harmonics" ...
Emotions that were in conflict with each other like a capacitor 《Condenser》 ……
The turbid love and the sticky air ……
"What are you thinking, let's have another drink"
Mr. Uchida picked up a glass of beer while looking at me, who would have won the sinking, with a sloppy eye.
"Hmm"
I put out my hand while rubbing my hot eyes
(Ah ...)
Dokin, there was a sound in my chest.
Through the golden liquid in the protruding glass, a small old wound on Uchida's right cheek spreads to fill the glass, just like when looking through the lens. It was embossed.
What's more, the wounds are the wounds and socks of that Michiko that I killed from the excitement of the moment, and the twisted red flesh ridges are like earthworms. There was an earthworm.
(... Mikoda ...)
Every time Uchida moaned his mouth, he whispered in a bubbling cup so that his child would squirm with Nita Nita.
"fool"
I knocked down the glass with all my strength. The cup broke into cobblestones, and the pieces rolled with a glaring, sharp light. ...... The shards of fragments that roll around to the corner of the room ...
"Why, I'm drunk"
Uchida looked at the floor with a hot face.
A small old wound was stuck to the right cheek with an "unknown face".
