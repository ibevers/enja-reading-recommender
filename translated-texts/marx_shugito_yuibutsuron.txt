Words have a magical function. For some, the name of materialism already implies something suspicious or filthy from the beginning. When they hear the name, they think that shaking their shoulders, cutting off the cross, and even taking it seriously is something of a savage thing to do. Nevertheless, Marxism, which insists on its own materialism, is a real force that no one can overlook. In general, those who try to show the nobility of thought by avoiding reality merely make up for themselves, and on the contrary, they happen to expose the dread and negligence of his thoughts. Just as philosophy once made significant progress with the excitement of the French Revolution, it can now also escape the current unproductive state, perhaps by somehow intermingling with Marxism. Marxism itself belongs to a long history of materialism, spoken in many different ways. People especially give this the name of modern materialism [# aside from "modern materialism"]. What exactly does the modernity crowned at this time mean? What kind of composition does Marxism define itself as materialism in the first place?
Those who try to grasp this question correctly are unfortunately most often associated with the name of materialism, one for theoretical views and the other for practical attitudes, two forms of materialism. You have to get rid of it far away. Marxism is not, in the first place, physiological materialism. It does not preach that the phenomenon of consciousness is derived from the physical structure of the brain itself, or that the idea is secreted from the human brain as if urine were excreted from the kidneys. Materialism like this is what Marx rejected by calling it metaphysical. By the way, Marxism is not secondly ethical materialism. It is not an assertion that all human actions should be subordinated to the satisfaction of material desires and the pursuit of personal well-being. Marx has made a terrible attack on such hedonistic and utilitarian ideas, which he always speaks of with contempt and hatred.
After the eighteenth-century-style, crude, crude materialism was rejected, how should we first acquire the real ground for Marxist materialism? We have already argued that the anthropology that defines the structure of materialistic views is based on proletariat basic experience. Therefore, it is clear that modern materialism also has a concrete source of its theory in the very modern proletariat basic experience [# aside from the "modern proletariat basic experience"]. It will have to be our current challenge. I hope that this imposed problem can be fully resolved.
The basic experience I mean is the whole structure of the actual existence. Real beings are always organized in certain structural links that are historically inevitably limited. Organization of existence: Aristotle's [# horizontal composition] τ * [# sharp accented α, 1-11-39] ξι * [# Greek lowercase final SIGMA, 1-6-57] [# horizontal composition end] ― -Lits most primitively in the dynamic dual unification of human and natural beings, which is the impetus for their overall composition. As long as it is in reality, human beings are beings in nature, or life, and nature is being limited in relation to this life. People have this concept, as the basic experience means to us a structured [# "structured" side point] or an organized existence [# "existence" side point], and thus exactly the very existence of reality. It should not be considered that the consciousness of someone [# aside from "the consciousness of someone"] or the experience is directly expressed by. When I say the basic experience of proletariat, I am not particularly conscious of the experience of the proletariat, or the experience of only the proletariat. On the contrary, I am referring to the very existence of reality with a special structure. One should understand what is above all in the name of basic experience, and never what is conscious and therefore also ideological. Rather, I have a certain structure and organization of conscious and ideological things-that is why existence can move and develop-for the first time in the process of movement and development of existence. I would like to insist that it becomes realistic. The "foundation" of basic experience means that this becomes the root of various forms of consciousness and defines it. Calling the very existence of reality itself "experience", as mentioned earlier, considers the existence to be completed in itself, and therefore grasps it especially in the movement [# "emphasis mark"]. This is to distinguish us as clearly as possible from the naive realism, which rather includes the tendency to fix it to something static. Thus, the basic experience is nothing but a dynamic, holistic existence that has various momentums to develop while mutually defining one's existence. However, what organizes and structures existence is basically the way of negotiating the existence of human beings. This method of negotiation itself is historically and socially limited, and "proletariat" is, so to speak, a historical type of such method of negotiation, and the reality defined by it. It is the historical character of existence itself. Therefore, we could probably justify it as one of the historical categories of existence [# an emphasis on the "historical category"].
By the way, it is labor that fundamentally defines the structure of the basic experience of proletariat. Proletariats negotiate with beings in a way of negotiation that is characterized as an emotional practice. At this time, the things they work with and with it cannot be as ideological as the image of their minds, if labor should maintain its essence. .. Practice essentially inevitably requires that in its existence the subject of it is another independent entity that is different from the one who practices it. As such, even in Fichte, who was the most thorough idealist, the ego, as the "resistance" to be overcome in order to exert its "practical" essence, is not the ego. It was thought that he requested, and thus inevitably led to the establishment of non-self. Rather, Fichte deduced a world of sensations, and thus sensibilities, from the practical fundamental rules of the ego. As long as humans negotiate practically, it is impossible for his working being to be an empty shadow in its existence. Of course, in Fichte, he was able to think that since practice was an endlessly wisdom activity, he would not lose his unselfish and ideological character, which he established as his own resistance. On the contrary, for us, practice is a human sensibility activity in itself as labor, so the existence that reveals its existence in such a way of negotiation is independent and sensibility until the end. It cannot be anything other than a material being. Labor makes all idealism impossible. Feuerbach says, "The fundamental flaw in idealism lies in the fact that it simply submits and solves the question of reality or non-existence of the objectivity or subjectivity of the world from a theoretical standpoint. In reality, the world is, for the first time, an object of enlightenment only because it is an object of will, for existence, and for possession * [# "*" is a line-right essay]. The speculative question of whether the world exists outside the mind, and whether it is sensuous and material, can even be a problem for those who negotiate with existence in labor. No, it is a matter that has been solved in one primitive fact.

By the way, as a person who has a structural connection with nature in labor, human beings must also be sensuous. He constantly works naturally with his material power, and in thus negotiating, he directly perceives his existence as sensibility. That is, labor structures nature as a sensibility and human beings as such. In this case, one should not understand sensibility abstractly. It does not mean something like the sensation itself or the pure sensation. On the contrary, sensibility is the concept of "the way of existence" of existence. It does not refer to the action of the soul or consciousness itself, but rather to this realistic human "existence"-"I am not the soul, but rather the human being", in a fragment of Plutak's lost book. There is one Greek philosopher in, who shows one special way that exists in the reality of its existence. It goes without saying that human beings are a psychophysical unity. When defining this being as sensibility, it does not take the position of sensualist idealism, but also by the way it contributes to the position of mechanical materialism, which preaches matter that is absolutely separated from the mind. Absent. "Truth is neither materialism nor idealism, nor physiology nor psychology. Truth is just anthropology (human studies) * [#" * "is a line-right essay]," Feuerbach said. He supports a concrete, anthropological position, as opposed to abstract idealism and materialism. Just as the soul does not think or feel, nor does the brain think or feel. Consciousness is nothing more than a concrete way of being as a whole human being. It must be understood in this sense that Marx "the consciousness (das Bewusstsein) can never be anything other than the conscious being (das bewusste Sein)". As a whole, the idea of absolutely confronting the spirit and the substance, excluding one and creating the other, is nothing more than a product of abstract thought. There again, Feuerbach wrote, "Separating humans into the body and mind, the emotional and non-sensitive essences is the only theoretical separation. In practice, in life, we do this. Deny separation ** [# "**" is a small line on the right side]. A Marxist who lives in practice cannot be an idealist, nor can he be a grasper of materialism in the abstract sense. Thus, the problem of materialism and ideology, such as "deriving" consciousness from matter or "deducing" existence from thought, must itself be released from a metaphysical point of view and moved to another ground. It's not. How can Marxism be materialistic without losing its concreteness? The answer has already been given. Existence defines its existence according to the way humans negotiate with it, but humans also grasp the essence of themselves directly according to the way they negotiate. Therefore, those who negotiate with existence in labor, that is, the practice of emotional materiality, will have to understand the existence or the way of existence of one's existence as emotional materiality. The "thing" in Marxian mere theory is thus the first concept of human self-interpretation, and if our term is allowed, in one hermeneutic concept [# aside from the "hermeneutic concept"]. Therefore, it should not mean the pure substance itself. Labor is the source of the very concrete materialism.

Labor is production under its more specific rules. However, modern production is particularly social in its style. Marx said at the beginning of the introduction to the Criticism of Economics, "The people who are producing in society-and thus the socially regulated production of people is the starting point, not to mention Smith and Rikaad. The individual isolated hunters and fishermen, who begin with, belong to the unimaginative fantasies of the eighteenth century. ”Our research should not begin with Robinson, an abstraction that does not exist in reality. , The human beings that are producing in society should be the starting point. Humans cannot produce without entering into a certain relationship with each other. They produce only by exchanging their activities with each other. As long as it's social, I can't just stay as me forever. As long as they interact with each other in their activities, I will be you and you will be me. I am to me, and at the same time you to others. I am both subjective and objective. Therefore Feuerbach's next words are correct: "The real I am just the one you are in opposition to, and this one himself is thy and objective to the other. For me, just as there is no objective in general, none of you also exist * [# "*" is a small line on the right side of the line]. The reality of human beings is established for the first time as the unification of me and you. Human beings are an integrated concept [# an emphasis on the "integrated concept"]. "I'm just subjective-objective (Sabjekt-Objekt), thinking, no, feeling ** [#" ** "is a small line on the right side of the line]. However, at this time, the integration or unification of the main customers (Einheit) is not directly equal to the same ([Identita: t]) of the two. Romantic's so-called identity system ([Identita: tssysteme]) asserted the absolute identity between subjectivity and objectiveness. On the contrary, to us, I and you, subjectivity and objectiveness are other beings that are infinitely different from each other-otherwise practical negotiations between each other would be impossible-and For that reason, human beings, as social beings, are the union of the main customers. From the last and first grounds of the reality of my being, I am essentially the one who relates me to other beings other than me, and I cannot do without this. If each human being thus is subjective, objective, and independent in that sense, then there is no longer an ideological absolute as producing or supporting any objective. The ego, or pure consciousness, will find no room to exist anywhere. Social production makes all kinds of absolute idealism impossible.

By negotiating with human beings in social production, one remarkable phenomenon is born here. That is, the burial of consciousness [# the emphasis mark on "the burial of consciousness"]. The "problem of consciousness" where traditional materialism has suffered the most to deal with, and thus has been a touchstone for all of them at every opportunity, is only reasonable by a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon. I believe that it can be solved concretely.
The central issue of modern epistemology is consciousness. Consciousness rather shapes the only or all research subject in modern philosophy. It is considered to be the first and last problem that any philosophy must deal with, and therefore the obvious, eternal problem. However, what is obvious to us is often only a bad cause for us, and what is eternal sometimes means what is destined for us. We cannot develop our scholarship or our lives unless we are in a position to control such things. Unless modern philosophy can find a superior position in the matter of consciousness that can do it freely, it will probably be stuck in a state of immobility, no longer able to move forward. .. In order to get out of this state, philosophy must pave the way for itself according to the special method we want to call the historically destructive method [# aside from the "historical destructive method"]. It's not. All beings are historic, and all historic beings are contradictions that inevitably transform from liberating us to oppressing us. Understanding this contradiction at the root of historical necessity is the method we require * [# "*" is a line right sutegana].

Every existence is a discovered existence. No existence is simply from the beginning, but we have encountered it and found it in history. There is history in the emergence of consciousness at the center of philosophy. Consciousness was first captured in its existence in the religious attitude of Christianity, which is the only and highest value in an individual's inner life, excluding all external and social life. It was Augustine who, in response to the demands of religious interest, revealed the reality and uniqueness of the inner world and revealed the infinite abundance of facts of consciousness. The consciousness thus discovered and revealed, leading to Descartes, was significantly transformed by an interest in the foundation of the certainty of cognition such as knowledge, especially mathematics and mechanics. In Augustine, Descartes' interpretation of consciousness is constantly guided by a dominant interest in scholarly cognition, whereas consciousness has been elucidated to the extent that it means something for spiritual life. [# "*" Is a small line on the right]. Kant also became aware of the consciousness of what was previously the "realm of existence" from this interest, although in him the imposition of universal validity of mathematical natural science was also its central issue. It was reinterpreted as "subjective" based on the concept of. At the same time, the subjectivity has ceased to be one of the beings, but rather has the universal meaning of turning to all beings and controlling them. Recently, Hussar's phenomenology-also for him a model of the ideology of the perception of mathematics and formal logic-discards Descartes's mind-body dualism, yet consciousness, in the case of Augustine. The most fundamental rule is to thoroughly interpret the existence of consciousness, which is manifested as fear and desire in relation to God, in the direction of Descartes' Cogito ergo sum, and all beings in this one. It bears the universal meaning of being reduced to it. In this way, the consciousness that was originally found in connection with religious innerness and whose existence was defined in that sense gradually departed from its roots and became pure theory, mainly formal logic, mathematics. , I was tasked with the foundation of the natural sciences, etc., and finally it was basically interpreted and clarified only from that point of view ** [# "**" is a small line on the right side of the line]. In the process of this transliteration (Umdeutung), consciousness gradually gained universal meaning. However, the universal meaning lies only in the "ghostly symmetry" ([gespenstige Gegensta: ndlichkeit]) in Marxian terms. The consciousness that once had the role of liberating human life now dominates us with its fixed youkai objectivity. Consciousness is now a contradiction. Marxist materialism must be the solution to this contradiction.

* It would be a lesson for us to see the conflict between Descartes and Augustine in contrast to Descartes and Pascal, who lived at the same time as him and was connected to Augustine's ideas. See "Human Studies in Pascal").
** Modern psychology is also not free from intellectual tendencies. Perception, representation, attention, and thought form the main problems there. On the contrary, what is it in medieval philosophical psychology? Emotions or Passions were the most preferred subject of it. Even at the beginning of the early modern period, Descartes and Spinoza, despite their intellectualist tendencies, still left behind a detailed and outstanding study of emotions.

When we step into the Greek ideological world, a whole new perspective opens up there. We no longer come across the so-called subjective concept. Instead of calling it subjective [# "subjective" to the emphasis mark] today, the Greeks are [# "we" to the emphasis mark] ([# horizontal writing] * [# with η, U + 1F21, 155-bottom-6 ] Με * [# Song accented ι, U + 1FD6, 155-bottom-6] * [# Greek lowercase final SIGMA, 1-6-57] [# horizontal composition end]). At the same time that the subjectivity is us, in response to the consciousness as the content of the subjectivity, we have the words [# "words" as emphasis marks] ([# horizontal writing] λ * [# sharp accented ο, U + 1F79, 155- Bottom-8] γο * [# Greek lowercase final SIGMA, 1-6-57] [# horizontal composition end]). To the Greeks, humans were social in nature, and the lonely human being was a contradictory concept in itself. Therefore, I mean us from the beginning [# "from the beginning" is "from the end" in the bottom line]. And as long as it is social, consciousness is always represented solely by Logos, but rather can only exist in Logos. So they put humans in a double rule, that is, social survival ([# horizontal composition] ζ * [# song accented ω, U + 1FF6, 155-bottom -15] ον πολιτικ * [# sharp accented] ο, U + 1F79, 155-bottom -15] ν [# horizontal composition end]), as a word survival ([# horizontal composition] ζ * [# song accented ω, U + 1FF6, 155-bottom -15] ον λογιστικ * [# sharp accented ο, U + 1F79, 155-bottom-16] ν [# horizontal composition end]), I thought that it could be defined most fundamentally. As long as we live socially, our individual consciousness is buried in the words of being public. By expressing one's consciousness in words, an individual cannot negotiate socially without immersing its subjectivity in words and making it public. Words are the only realistic consciousness in society [# aside from "realistic consciousness"]. Marx, who considered human beings as historical and social beings, said, "Words are old with consciousness-words are practical, exist for other human beings, and therefore exist for myself, realistic. And words, like consciousness, arise only from the desire and need for traffic with other human beings * [# "*" is a line right essay]. Here, the layer of moving air, the sound, or simply the spirit combined with the substance that appears in the form of words, was considered consciousness. The "pure" consciousness that curses matter cannot be practical. We can find a similar idea in Feuerbach, "Human is willing to convey his most inner thoughts, feelings, and desires through the organ of speaking to humans. By the way, this emotional expression. What is the soul, the inside, and the essence itself, distinguished from the essence that was made ** [# "**" is a small line on the right side of the line]. "

Therefore, I will be willing to study the most notable effects of words on existence. Words are social in their concreteness. Speaking has the structure that one person speaks to another person about something * [# "*" is a line right sutegana]. Due to this structure of words, what is said is neither mine to speak nor his to listen to [# "not" is "not" in the bottom line], it belongs to a particular person. Not our joint. At this time, the person who owns the existence is "we", "the world", and "person" in a categorical sense (German [# horizontal composition] "man" [# horizontal composition end] -French ≪on≫). Existence becomes public in a sufficient sense only through the mediation of words. And society is established only by owning the world publicly. When a word is social, it means that a society exists by the word. Aristotle also states that the fact that humans have logos is the reason why he is particularly social. ** [# "**" is a small note on the right side of the line]. However, when existence is expressed by words, becomes social, and crawls into a world that is established in the category of "people," it bears one remarkable character. That is what we call the mediocrity of existence [# "emphasis mark" to "generality"] or the neutralization [# "emphasis mark" to "neutralization"]. Suppose I'm going to buy a desk now. I told the owner of the furniture store, "Give me a desk." At this time he will immediately understand me and take out some desks and show them to me. He can understand me because the desk is neutralized in words. On the way back from the furniture store, I take the train. There will be high-ranking officials in the car. There will also be merchants at the end of the field. Others will devote themselves to sadness, and others will be full of joy. However, in this case all of them are mediocre in the word passenger, but rather experienced from the point of view of this word. If a few vacant seats are then found in the car, I will sit down to the seats given to me, no matter which one. That is because all those vacant seats are neutralized as vacant seats. This neutralization of existence enables our particularly social practices. If the desk couldn't exist neutrally, the merchant would sell the desk and I wouldn't be able to buy one. Words are practical rather than theoretical in their roots. The phenomenon of mediocrity of existence makes this clear above all else. Understanding that language is socially practical in nature is extremely important for today's people who are accustomed to thinking logic or theory with Logos in the first place. In connection with that, one must be totally free from the common misconception that the neutralization of existence is regarded as if it were based on the universality of the concept. It is generally believed that my understanding of a furniture store is due to the universality of the concept of a desk. However, when I say "give me a desk," I do not mean an abstract, or theoretically universal, desk, but rather I buy a concrete, realistic desk. I want to go. Moreover, the word desk at that time does not mean the very specific desk that I buy and return after selecting and examining the various desks indicated by the merchant from the very beginning. If so, it would be difficult to understand why merchants take out several desks instead of one, and why I make choices and scrutiny. The neutralization of existence is not established by the abstraction or universality of the concept, nor is it based on its peculiarity or individuality. Rather, it is independent, concrete, and expresses its existence. Simply put, it is the so-called "good" of existence Jeweiligkeit. The existence of any reality is meant by its mediocrity. Aristotle's [# horizontal writing] τ * [# heavy accented ο, U + 1F78, 158-top-2] * [# Rough breathing and sharp accented ε, U + 1F15, 158-top-2] καστον [# Horizontal end] is an existence in such a character, and is not a so-called individual thing as is often thought. The mediocrity of existence has its roots in the fact that words are of a practical nature at first, and that this practice is of a social nature in nature. At this time, the existence is, of course, a negotiating existence. In the form of "consciousness-subjectivity" mentioned in the previous paragraph, the thing to it is an objective or object existence, but on the contrary, in the form of "word-we", the thing to it is a negotiating existence. There is no other choice. Therefore, the Greeks used the words [# horizontal composition] πρ * [# song accented α, U + 1FB6, 158-top-12] γμα [# horizontal composition end]. By the way, it is clear that the consciousness is buried in the mediocrity of existence. The love and hate we nostalgic for existence, all subjective and internal, are buried there, and therefore the subjective and internal provisions of existence are hidden and hidden there. .. But what will be gained will be greater than what is thus lost. Human social and practical provisions can be exercised and satisfied there. However, most notably, the mediocrity of beings, which once helped to develop human sociality in this way, has now turned into a stake in its development. In order for such a conversion to take place, significant changes must already be achieved in the structure of the very existence of reality. The principle of mediocrity of existence in modern times is commodities [# "emphasis marks"]. As commodities gradually became the dominant category and eventually became the universal category, the mediocrity of existence reached the point of restraining and hindering the development of human sociality. The mediocrity of existence thus fell into a contradiction, and at the same time Logos had to fall into the same contradiction. We will try to consider this.

It is no coincidence that Marx's two great and mature works, both of which attempted to uncover the whole of capitalist society and show its fundamental character, were started with the analysis of goods. In modern times, society is actually a product-producing society. At this stage of human development, the ultimate analysis of any problem always points to the product, and its final mystery always lies in the structure of the product. The problem of commodities is not a special problem of economics as a special science, but a central problem of it, but rather an overall problem of the capitalist society itself. The structure of goods is the archetype of the form of objectivity of all beings in this society. Depending on this social characteristic, the tendency of mediocrity of existence is pushed to the limit. And accordingly, consciousness becomes more and more buried in our real life, and thus the materialization of being becomes more and more dominant. There, human labor, its most inner thing, is just one product. Even the most material labor does not prevent it from having a spiritual meaning. At one point, serving another and working for another would have been a manifestation of one moral spirit. However, in a capitalist society in which commodities dominate as a universal category of overall social existence, not only conscious relationships between human beings, but all social relationships themselves are buried and immersive. The essence of the structure of goods is that the relationship between human beings has a material character, thus hiding in this one any trace of the relationship between human beings in its own strict law. It exists in the place that gives the youkai objectivity of. By nature, each labor is part of social overall labor, and all of them depend on each other. But that is, in our society, the social links between human beings, who effectively work for each other, are done in a way that is hidden in our eyes. In the world of capitalism, the labor bond between humans is invisible. What is it by? Because all things take the form of commodities, move in the market, and humans do not rationally dominate the market, but rather the market dominates humans at that price. Relationships between humans thus appear as relationships between products. This is exactly what Marx called "the magic of goods" (Fetischcharakter der Ware [# "Ware" is "Waare" in the bottom line]) and revealed the secret. He writes, "The whole secret of the form of goods is therefore simply that it gives humans the social nature of their own labor, the object nature of the labor product itself, the society of these things. It lies in the reflection of the natural nature of the target, and thus also the social relationship of the producer to total labor as the social relationship of the object that exists outside them. By this quid pro quo, the labor product Is a product, that is, a thing that becomes super-sensitive or social .... What is reflected in people's eyes in the fantastic form of the relationship between things is just human beings themselves. It is nothing but a certain social relationship * [# "*" is a small line on the right side of the line]. This magical nature of the world of commodities stems from the peculiar social nature of the labor that produces commodities. This fundamental fact leads to the movement of things, in which the mutual labor of human beings is hidden behind them, to make its own movement according to its own law, and conversely to rule human beings. It confronts human beings with his own activities, his own labor as something objective, independent of him, that is, as a commodity, governing him by his own laws, unrelated to humans. It will be. Simply put, humans are dominated by what they make. Here "human self-estrangement" (die menschliche Selbstentfremdung) is fulfilled. The characteristic of capitalist society is that it is universally completed in self-estrangement, such as the mediocreization of existence.

What is the possibility of a proletariat in this society? The objective reality of a social entity is "identical" to both the proletariat and the proletariat in its directness [# "emphasis mark"]. The proletariat appears as an inevitable product of the capitalist social order. The proletariat therefore shares all the materialization of life with the proletariat. However, the category in which both classes raise this same direct reality to the original objective reality in its mediation [# "emphasis mark"] is the aspect of the existence of both classes. As they differ, they must be fundamentally different. Marx expresses this in the following clear words: "The proletariat and the proletariat represent the same human self-estrangement, but the first class is happy in this self-estrangement. Feeling and certainty, knowing this alienation as his own power, and in which he possesses the phantom of human existence. The second feels denied in this alienation, in which his powerlessness and non-powerfulness. See the reality of human existence, "he further tells us," Proletariat, because the abstraction from all humanity, even from the phantom of humanity, is practically perfected in the developed proletariat. Humans have lost themselves in proletariat because, among their living conditions, all living conditions of today's society are summed up at its most inhuman apex, but at the same time the theoretical of this loss. Not only has it gained consciousness, but it can no longer be refused, it can no longer be obscured, it is in the cramps of absolute command-in the practical expression of inevitability-and thus directly rebellion against this inhumanity. Therefore, the proletariat can and must release itself * [# "*" is a small line on the right side of the line]. In this way, two conflicting practical attitudes towards the same direct reality are possible. Since the producers have been affirmed for their existence in the self-estrangement of this society, according to the inevitability of their existence, separate this form of alienation from its capitalist ground and therefore its history. , Make it independent, and eternalize it-the relationships between human beings structured in the form of goods-as a timeless paradigm of the possibilities of human relationships in general. It seems that eternity like this is possible for the time being. This is because the structure of goods has now reached the point where it has a universal meaning as a prototype of the symmetry of social existence in general. So they establish the so-called "eternal" ideology and the so-called "universally valid" theory to realize this eternity. To tell the truth, this self-abstract eternity or universal validity is nothing but a reflection of the abstraction of human self-estrangement in commodities from humanity itself. In the process of the development of capitalism, the structure of commodities constantly goes deeper, more fatefully, more constructively into human consciousness. All logos, under the universal and decisive control of the category of goods, are transformed into ideologies in a bad sense, abstracted from human beings and thus separated from reality, and thus humanity. Suppress and oppress the development of. However, producers are not given the possibility to criticize such an idealism in their existence. For some reason their existence is directly affirmed there, and therefore their existence is refused to be considered in the process and in history. On the contrary, the proletariat can and must grasp its existence in terms of motility and history because its existence is denied in the present society, and because of its negativity. Absent. They understand that the so-called eternal theory stands on the historical conditions of capitalist society. "The idea of the ruling class is the dominant idea in each era ** [#" ** "is a small line on the right side of the line]. They understand that the so-called universally valid idealism is nothing more than an idealism of the maternity class. Proletariat is inevitably critical, according to the inevitability of its existence. I will also see the characteristics of this criticism, and in connection with it, the characteristics of Marxist materialism.

The criticism that found the idealism in the separation from reality must inevitably start from the reality itself. Therefore, materialism first means realism and positivism to that extent. Feuerbach, who was engaged in criticizing religious ideology as a precursor to Marx, has already noted that "the speculation was a religion, but the speculation was thought by itself, and much better than the religion. It defines religion without defining oneself from religion. It does not leave oneself. However, I do religion and speak myself. I am simply with the listener of it. I act as an interpreter and do not look after it. Instead of devising it-to remove the cover, to "reveal the existence of reality" was my sole purpose. See it correctly. That was my only effort * [# "*" is a small line on the right]. That is, what he tried to do in "The Essence of Christianity" was "a historical-philosophical analysis that is faithful to the thing and most closely adheres to its object ** [#" ** ". "Is a small note on the right side of the line]" (eine sachgetreue, ihrem Gegenstand sich aufs Strengste anschliessende, historischphilosophische Analyse). He also said, "I am nothing but a spiritual natural researcher, by the way, a natural researcher cannot do anything without instruments and without material means." Is the so-called experience. It would be rather strange if we could not find a similar idea in Marx. In fact, he says [# "I'm saying" is "when" in the bottom line], "The premise we start with is not voluntary, not dogma, and then one just imagines. It is a realistic premise that can only be abstracted in .... These premise can be confirmed in a purely empirical way *** [# "***" is a line right essay]. We also say, "This way of thinking is not unconditional. It starts with a realistic premise and does not leave it, even momentarily. That premise is in some kind of fantasy of human beings in closure and fixation. Rather, they are human beings in the process of development that can be seen realistically and empirically under certain conditions. " Marx calls the historical materialistic view of history as "die reale Geschichtschreibung", in opposition to traditional ideological historical narratives. Line right writing]. As if Marxism is realism in the true sense of the word. And this would be an inevitable consequence of the theoretical composition of Marxism. This theory originally contains an opportunity for practice within itself. However, in order to act on existence practically and to be able to control it practically, we must recognize the law of existence itself. "Nature cannot be conquered unless it follows it," is Bacon's famous phrase. The theory of change in reality has no other way than to cling to reality and to find out the law of its movement. Marxism, as a theory of revolution, cannot be an idealism in a bad sense that is far from reality.

It is extremely important to recognize the critical and practical significance of materialism. Marx clarifies this significance in confronting French materialism in The Holy Family. According to him, French materialism has two directions: one with its origin in Descartes and one with its origin in rock. Whereas the former flowed into the original natural sciences, the latter was directly combined with socialism or communism. Fourier, for example, derives directly from the idea of French materialism. The link between communism and materialism in the eighteenth century lies primarily in the sharpness of its criticisms of theology, idealistic metaphysics, and the morals influenced by both. Materialism taught that human morals and value judgments change with time and circumstances, in opposition to the dogmatic beliefs of theology, the eternal ideas and ideas of metaphysics and ethics. Marx shows that British and French socialism or communism is particularly closely linked to the social criticism of materialism. From the materialistic theory of "goodness of human nature, equal intellectual genius, experience, customs, universality of education, influence of external circumstances on human beings, significant meaning of industry, endorsement of enjoyment, etc." , It does not require any great scrutiny to gain insight into the inevitable link between it and communism and socialism * [# "*" is a small line on the right]. ". The practical philosophy of materialism was, above all, the basis of communism. However, Marx also found that this philosophy of practice was, above all, the basis of communism. However, Marx at the same time unmistakably recognized the flaws in the theoretical aspects of materialism related to this philosophy of practice, and thus also of this philosophy of practice itself. The flaw is, first of all, that the mechanical materialism of the eighteenth century did not understand anything about the historical nature of existence. Therefore it had to end up in an abstract theory, and the practical philosophy on it had to end up in another fantasy. It didn't know a truly realistic, and in that sense, a truly academic way. In "Capital," Marx notes that "the flaw in abstract, natural science materialism lies in excluding historical processes ** [#" ** "is a line-right essay]." On the contrary, the Marxian method, which is "the only materialistic and therefore academic method" (die einzig materialistische und daher wissenschaftliche Methode), grasps reality in its reality, in the historical process. To do. Second, "the main flaws of all conventional materialism (including Feuerbach's) are that objects, reality, and sensibilities are grasped only in the form of objective or intuition, and sensibilities.・ It is not grasped as a human activity or practice, and is not grasped subjectively *** [# "***" is a small line on the right side of the line]. The so-called "pure materialists" analyze and decompose human beings as static and observant beings. On the contrary, for Marxism, the act of production-the act of exchanging materials between human beings and nature-is the basis of human existence, life, and consciousness. "There was an act in the beginning" (Am Anfang war die Tat), and therefore humans acted before they thought-this is the root of Marxist materialism.

Traditional materialism is as if it were a flaw on the right, and the transformative practices that stand on it merely portray utopia, or simply the theoretical transformation of ideology without itself leading to a revolutionary transformation of the extant world. I just requested. All of these materialisms are one-sided. This is because materialism loses its realist essence when it is put into fantasy practice, and cannot exert its materialistic qualities when it is kept within the limits of idealism. Simply put, all of them do not understand the dialectical unification of theory and practice [# the emphasis on "dialectical unification of theory and practice"]. What grasps this is exactly Marxist materialism. This one values theory in the first place. It defines oneself as scientific socialism as opposed to utopian socialism. "There can be no revolutionary movement without the theory of revolution" (Lenin), is its motto. A faithful historical and philosophical analysis of reality is its primary challenge. Second, this materialism is practical in nature. Marx says, "For a practical materialist, that is, a communist, the problem is to revolutionize the existing world and to work and change the present things in a practical manner. * [#" * "Is a small line. Write]. However, Marxism brings theory and practice into dialectical unification, rather than simply confronting them as the first and the second. There, theory is as much as the theory requires, and practice is as much as the theory teaches. The conflict between theory and practice is mutually constrained, practice develops by being guided by theory, and thus developed practice requires theory at a newer stage. Theory develops practice as well as self-development, and thus developed theory requires practice in a newer stage. Theory and practice develop with each other through each stage in such inevitable unification. Due to such dialectical unification, theory can never be separated from the actual ground. The reason why Marxism is an idealism, but can never be an idealism in a bad sense lies fundamentally here. Also, as if for that reason, one should not consider dogmas fixed under the concept of Marxism, but rather always understand the realistic theory in the process of development. And that is why Marxism is neither relativism nor absolutism in traditional philosophical terminology. In the dialectical unification of this theory and practice, Marxism reaches the pinnacle of its reality [# aside from "reality"]. The most peculiar and most predominant theory that Marxism has, not only for traditional materialism, but for all idealisms, is expressed in dialectics like this. And such qualities will be born as an inevitable consequence of Marxism as long as the basic experience of proletariat is the actual ground of it. Even if another worker builds a desk, he saws wood, planes it, pierces it with a chisel, and combines it. This is required step by step from his labor process itself. He needs that law when sawing, but then he doesn't need the law of using a plane. This is only needed when he reaches the stage of planening. The practice of sawing inevitably requires the law of planening. Alternatively, the law of using a saw is inevitably transformed into the law of using a plane. Thus, in proletariat, theory and practice are dialectical unification, without which he would not have his existence, so for him the so-called idealism would not be possible. It is.

Because Marxism knows the dialectical unification of theory and practice, it cannot know any reason or any Zollen. Marx says, "Communism is not a state that we should create, reality is not an ideal that must be followed. We call the realistic movement that stops the present state communism. The conditions of the movement arise from the existing premise * [# "*" is a small line on the right side of the line]. Engels also said, "Marx therefore never based his communist demands on our moral sentiment, rather he was fulfilling it day by day in front of us. Based on the inevitable collapse of a capitalist production society, he is content to say that one simple fact is that surplus value consists of unpaid labor. ** [# "**" is a small line on the right side]. By the way, according to Marxism, this theoretical necessity must have a practical expression. Marx thinks that the plight of proletariat (Noth) is exactly the practical expression of this necessity (der praktische Ausdruck der Nothwendigkeit). Now that the masses of mankind have become totally "non-fertile", their poverty is no longer enduring. Capitalist production methods in the future of this reality have become an "unbearable" force, and it has become unavoidable to revolutionize them. The predicament of the proletariat thus commands social change in an absolute command that can no longer be rejected. This is the "practical premise" of Marxist theory. Since Marxism stands on the dialectical unification of theory and practice, it suspends the material poverty and distress of all proletariats in its theory. Here lies one source of Marxism's definition of self as materialism.

Now that the proletariats are born advocates because of the special structure of their basic experience, they are totally materialized in order to free themselves from material poverty, and the whole society itself. I can't follow any spiritual way that has nothing to do with the reality of. Rather, this dialectic inevitably reminds them that they can transform not only their reality, but the whole society of reality, only by asserting their material demands most thoroughly. However, to tell the truth, it is not just matter, according to the essence of dialectic, that is released by the most thorough assertion of matter. Marx has already said, "Proletariat, but without aufheben of his own living conditions, he cannot release himself, proletariat is summed up in his state of all in today's society. Without affirming the inhuman living conditions, he cannot affirm his own living conditions * [# "*" is a small line on the right side of the line]. The essence of the proletariat movement is not to liberate him or his proletariat, but rather to liberate the entire proletariat, and this is rather according to the historical essence of the proletariat itself. It cannot be realized without stopping all classes. As such, a proletariat who demands the release of matter does not demand the release of this or his material desires, but rather the release of all material life, and this is dialectical. According to the inner essence of materialism itself, it cannot be achieved without liberating the whole human life. It is not just matter, not just the spirit, that is released by the most thorough assertion. On the contrary, the substance and the spirit are suspended and the whole human nature itself is released. There the oppressed material will be free, and the buried consciousness will be restored. There the whole material and spiritual human being begins to shine in its wholeness. --I hope my work has provided some clarification to Marxism as historical materialism.
