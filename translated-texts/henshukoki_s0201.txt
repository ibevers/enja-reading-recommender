Editor's Note (January 1945)
"Blue Sky" Article
Motojiro Kajii

The fact that only a small amount of things could be loaded compared to the usual month is due to the fact that there was a movement in the economic measures of the blue sky, but I, who was in charge of editing, could not work as if I was ill. This is because of the fact. I must thank my partner Miyoshi for causing a lot of trouble.
The blue sky has passed two years. I think that the worshipers can feel that the constant growth has been achieved. Along with that, preparations for new developments will come out inside. It is a great pleasure for me to see what kind of results it will bring this year. In terms of life, many of the same people are promised to change their lives with graduation this March.
It is regrettable that the manuscript received from Mr. Kintou, a critique of Doujin Asanuma, was not posted in this month's è™Ÿ. Doujin Abe didn't write anything to write his graduation thesis. Be sure to write something in the coming months.
We would like to express our deepest sympathies to the donated magazine.
