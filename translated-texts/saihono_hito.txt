[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 1 Look at this person [# middle heading end]

I loved Christo artistically about ten years ago-especially Katritsk. The "Temple of Our Lady of Japan" in Nagasaki still remains in my memory. I'm just a crow who picked up the seeds sown by Hakushu Kitahara and Mokutaro Kinoshita. Then, a few years ago, I was interested in the Christians who had been martyred for Christ. The psychology of the martyr has given me a morbid interest in the psychology of all fanatics. I loved him and the four biographical authors, Christo, who passed on to us around this time. Christ cannot be seen by me today as a person on the path. Or, not only the red-haired people, but also today's young people will be laughed at. But born at the end of the nineteenth century, I was tired of seeing them-I turned my eyes to the cross, which hesitated to overthrow. Born in Japan, "My Christ" does not necessarily look at the Sea of Galilee. You can also see the cove in Nagasaki under the red red and fruit ivy persimmon trees. Therefore, I do not care about historical facts and geographical facts. (It's not at least for the journalist to avoid difficulties. If you're serious about it, the 56 Cristo biography can easily do this.) And one of Cristo's I can't afford to faithfully list one word. I write "my Christ" just as I felt. Even the harsh Japanese Christians will probably overlook only the Christ written by the Baibunsha.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 2 Maria [# middle heading end]

Maria was just a woman. However, one night he felt the Holy Spirit and immediately gave birth to Christ. We feel some Maria in every woman. At the same time, also in every boy. No, we can feel some Maria in the fire that burns in the fire, the vegetables in the field, the unglazed bottle "Kame" and the tatami mat "Gandefu". Maria is not "a woman forever". It's just "what you want to protect forever". Christ's mother, Maria's life, also went through the Valley of Tears. However, Maria walked through this life with patience. Satoshi, foolishness, and virtue live together in her lifetime. Niichie's rebellion was more rebellious against Mary than against Cristo.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 3 Holy Spirit [# middle heading end]

We can feel some Holy Spirit in the wind and flags. The Holy Spirit is not always "holy." It's just "an eternal super-enjoyment". Goethe always gave the Holy Spirit the name of Daemon. Not only that, I was always wary of not being caught by this Holy Spirit. But the children of the Holy Spirit-every Christ is at risk of being caught for the Holy Spirit someday. The Holy Spirit is not a devil or an angel. Of course, it is also different from God. I sometimes see the Holy Spirit walking on the equinoctial week of good and evil. On the other side of good and evil-but fortunately or unfortunately, Rombrozoo found the Holy Spirit walking on the mind of a mentally ill person.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 4 Joseph [# middle heading end]

Christ's father, carpenter Joseph, was actually Maria himself. It is based on the fact that he is not as respected as Maria. No matter how he favored him, Joseph was the foremost person of the extraordinary "Hitsukiyau".

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 5 Elizabetsu [# middle heading end]

Maria was a friend of Elizabeth. It was this Zakariabe's wife, Elizabeth, who gave birth to John the Baptism. It is no wonder that the poppy flowers bloomed in the wheat by chance. The power that governs our lives also moves there.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 6 Hitachi Hitachi [# middle heading end]

It is certain that the fact that she felt the Holy Spirit of Mary and was conceived was so ugly that it made the shepherds make a noise. From this time on, Christ's mother, beautiful Maria, began to suffer from human suffering.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 7 Doctors [# middle heading end]

The doctors in the eastern country saw the appearance of Christ's star and offered gold, frankincense, and myrrh in a treasure box. However, they were only a few of the doctors. The other doctors were unaware of the appearance of Christ's star. Not only that, one of the doctors who noticed, standing on a high platform (he was older than anyone else), looked up at the bright star and looked far at Christ. I was merciful.
"Mataka!"

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 8 Herod [# middle heading end]

Herod was a big machine. The cloud machine is always necessary for us to save some effort due to violence. He killed all the young children of Bethlehem in fear of Christ. Of course, Cristo other than Cristo [# "Emphasis mark to Cristo other than Cristo"] also appears to be true among them. Herod's hands may have turned red because of their blood. We probably can't help feeling uncomfortable in front of these hands. But it is annoyance to guillotine centuries ago. We cannot hate Herod, of course, and despise him. No, I just feel mercy for him. Herod always looks down on the country of Bethlehem in the depression and figs, with his melancholy face on the throne. Without leaving anything in the poem of the line. ......

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 9 Bohemian spirit [# middle heading end]

Young Cristo goes to Egypt, and also stops at "Mura, an eup called Nazareth, avoiding it in Galilee". We also find young children in the families of naval officers who transfer them to Sasebo and Yokosuka. Christ's Bohemian spirit may have lurked in the context of his own personality.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 10 [# "10" is tate-chu-yoko] Father [# middle heading end]

After living in Nazareth, Cristo learned that he was not a child of Joseph. Or being a child of the Holy Spirit-but it's no more serious than the former. "Child of Man" Christo was born for the very second time since this time. "The maid's child," Strintbury, first rebelled against his family. It was his misery and at the same time his happiness. Christ probably did the same thing. He encountered Christ-Baptism John, who was born before him in the midst of his loneliness. We also feel the shadow of Christ's heart before meeting John in ourselves. John ate wild honey and locusts and lived in the wilderness. However, the wilderness where he lived was not necessarily without sunlight. Compared to the dim wilderness that was at least in Christ himself ...

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 11 [# "11" is tate-chu-yoko] John [# middle heading end]

Baptism John was a Christ who couldn't understand romanticism. His dignity remains brilliantly there as in the case of Aragane. It is probably in that fact that he did not reach Christ. John, who baptized Christ, was * [# "tree + solution", 3rd level 1-86-22]. However, in prison, John the Apostle had already lost the power of the tree on its branches and leaves * [# "Tree + Solution", Level 3 1-86-22]. His last roar always moves us like Christ's last roar. -
"Are you or me?"
John's last moaning--no, it's not always the moaning. Thick * [# "Tree + Solution", Level 3 1-86-22] The tree is dead, but it still has branches in appearance. If you were young, and if you didn't have this energy, Christo, who was twenty years old, would never be cold.
"It's good to tell John what I'm doing."

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 12 [# "12" is tate-chu-yoko] Devil [# middle heading end]

After fasting forty days, Cristo asked the devil around his eyes. We also need some kind of fasting [# aside from "some kind of fasting"] in order to ask and answer the devil. Some of us will lose the temptation of the devil in this question and answer. Some will protect ourselves without losing temptation. But sometimes we don't ask and answer the devil throughout our lives. Cristo first rejected the bread. However, I did not forget to give an annotation saying, "I can't live with bread alone [#" only with "aside point]." He then rejected the devil's idealistic advice, which he called himself a tribute to his own power. But he also prepared a dialectic saying, "Don't try the Lord your God." Finally, he rejected "the countries of the world and their glory." It appears to be the same as or the same as repelling bread. However, the fact that the bread was rejected was nothing more than the rejection of realistic desires. In this third answer, Christ rejected all the dreams of the earth that never cease in ourselves. A logical duel beyond this logic was no different from Christ's victory. It was probably a duel with Jacob's angel. The devil was nothing more than hanging his head in front of Christ on the ridge. But I never forgot that he was a child of a woman named Maria. This question and answer with the devil will someday be given a serious meaning. However, in Christo's life, it cannot be said that it is a big incident. He repeatedly said in his lifetime, "Satan, dismiss." In fact, one of his biographers-Luke wrote this incident and then added, "Everyone who tried this devil | Biography.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 13 [# "13" is tate-chu-yoko] First disciples [# middle heading end]

Cristo shows his genius when he is only twelve years old. However, no one became a disciple even after being baptized. As he walked from village to village, he felt lonely. But at last the four disciples-and the four fishermen became obedient to his left and right. Christ's love for them goes through his life. Surrounded by them, he became an ancient journalist with a sharp tongue to see.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 14 [# "14" is tate-chu-yoko] Child of the Holy Spirit [# end of middle heading]

Cristo became an ancient journalist. At the same time, he became an ancient Bohemian. His genius continued to leap, and his life trampled on the social promises of an era. Occasionally hysterical among the disciples who do not understand him. -But it was almost full of joy to himself. How passionate Christ was in his poetry. "To Yamagami no Kyo" is an inspiring product of his twenty-odd years old. He felt that his predecessor was only young to him. His genius diaanalysis, which was so high in the sea, of course invited enemies. But they couldn't go to the point of not being afraid of Christ. It really wasn't for them-to those who knew life better than Christ, and thus had a fear of life again, because they couldn't swallow this genius's quantity.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 15 [# "15" is tate-chu-yoko] Woman [# middle heading end]

Many women loved Christ. Among them, Mary Magdalene and others forgot to be attacked by seven evil spirits because they met him once, and felt a poetic romance that transcended her profession. After the end of Christ's life, it was the power of love that saw him on her toes. Cristo also loved a large number of women-especially Mary Magdalene. Their poetic romance is still as scented as the swallow flower iris. Christo often comforted his loneliness by seeing her. The progeny-or the progeny boys were cold-hearted about their poetic romance. However, later women were always jealous of this Maria (other than the artistic subject).
"Why didn't Cristo show his mother Maria the rebirth before anyone else?"
It was the most hypocritical sigh that they had leaked.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 16 [# "16" is tate-chu-yoko] miracle [# middle heading end]

Cristo sometimes performed miracles. But it was easier for him than to make a metaphor. For that reason, he had an aversion to miracles. For that reason, [# "emphasis mark"]-I felt the mission of Christ was to teach his way. Performing his miracles was no different from the inconvenience of teaching his way, as Ruthsoo's roaring progeny. But his "lambs" always wanted a miracle. Christ couldn't obey this request once every three times. His human, too human character is also exposed on one side. However, Christ always avoided liability every time he performed a miracle.
"Your faith has ridiculed you."
However, at the same time, it was not different from the scientific truth. Cristo also lost his power because he was forced to perform a miracle at one time--or | because he was struck by his garment, a woman who suffered from a long illness. I felt a miracle. It is clear that he always hesitated to perform his miracles. Christ was a much sharper rationalist than his twelve disciples, as well as later Christians.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 17 [# "17" is tate-chu-yoko] Immoral [# middle heading end]

Cristo's mother, beautiful Maria, was not necessarily a mother for Cristo. His most beloved one followed his path. Christo was also enthusiastic, and was not foolish to let go of his daring feelings before a large crowd gathered. Maria stood up in a hurry, listening to his words outside the door. We feel Maria's suffering in ourselves. Even if we feel Christ's passion in ourselves-but Christ himself sometimes seems to have mercy on Mary. When you look at Jerusalem as it is without looking at the glorious gates of heaven. ......

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 18 [# "18" is tate-chu-yoko] Christo [# middle heading end]

Cristo religion is a poetic religion with many paradoxes that Cristo himself could not carry out. He laughed at his life and threw him away for his genius. It's no wonder that Wild found him a leading romanticist. According to his teaching, "at the height of Solomon's glory, the calyx" was a young lily flower blown by the wind. His path is just poetic-to think about tomorrow's day and live as if it were a mess. For what? -Of course, it was not wrong to go to the heaven of the Jews. However, no heaven can be reached without a change. Christo's heaven, full of soapy roses, has disappeared into the air someday. But instead we create some heaven. Christ gave us * [# "Rissinben + Iwazukuri", 3rd level 1-84-54] * [# "Rissinben + brother", 3rd level 1-84-45] "Shiyaukei" He was the first person to evoke. Furthermore, his paradox gave rise to countless theologians and mystics in later generations. Their argument can be taken without stunning Christ. But some of them are even more Christian than Christ. Christ pointed to us at the other side of this world. We always see in Christ what we are looking for-the voice of Ratsupa, who drives us to an infinite path. At the same time, I can't help but feel the world's suffering, which is always the one in Christ who has been abusive to us-the modern one.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 19 [# "19" is tate-chu-yoko] Journalist [# middle heading end]

We are only close to ourselves, but we cannot see outside. At the very least, the only things that come close to us are those that are close to ourselves. Christ was aware of this fact just like any journalist. Bride, vineyard, donkey, craftsman-I've never had a chance to use what I see in his teachings. "The Parable of the Good Samaritan" and "The Return of the Prodigal Son" are masterpieces of his poetry. Later Christian Jiaanalysts who used only abstract words-the pastors never considered the effect of Cristo's Jiaanalysis. He is by no means inferior to the Christians of his later generation, of course, compared to them. For that reason, his journalism is on par with the Western classics. He was a jaanalist who added new firewood to a really old flame.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 20 [# "20" is tate-chu-yoko] Jehovah [# middle heading end]

Of course, it was the heavenly god that Christo often preached. "It is not God who made us, God is what we made."-The words of the materialist Guulmon, who say so, please our hearts. It is a word that squeezes a chain hanging on our waist. But at the same time, it is a word that adds a new chain to our waist. Not only that, this new chain may be stronger than the old chain. God descended from the large clouds into the fine nervous system. Moreover, it is still there under every name. Christ, of course, often sees this god in his eyes. (It is unthinkable that he met the devil of Christ who had never met God.) His god is also socially strong like any god. However, there is no doubt that he was the "main god" who was born with me. Christ continued to fight for this god-for poetic justice. Every his paradox originates there. Later theology sought to interpret those paradoxes most out of poetry. Then-leaving a myriad of boring books that no one had ever read. Vorteel nowadays wields his sword to kill the humorous "theological" god. But the "Lord God" did not die. At the same time, Cristo did not die again. God will always face us as long as moss grows on the walls of the concrete. Dante fell Francieska to hell. But one day she saved this woman from the flames. Those who have repented even once-those who have beautiful moments always enter into "endless life". It is probably because of the fact that it is easy to be called a sentimental god.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 21 [# "21" is tate-chu-yoko] Hometown [# middle heading end]

"The Prophet cannot enter his hometown."-Or it may have been the first cross for Christ. He had to make all Jews home to Tsuhi. Trains, cars, steamers and planes make every Christ home all over the world today. Of course, no doubt every Christ was not able to enter his hometown. In fact, the one with Poe was France, not the United States.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 22 [# "22" is tate-chu-yoko] poet [# middle heading end]

Cristo feels that a lily flower is even more beautiful than "the height of Solomon's glory". (None of his disciples are as ecstatic as he is about the beauty of lily flowers.) But when talking to his disciples, even if he breaks the politeness of conversation, it is barbaric. I wasn't foolish to say that. ―― "I don't know that people can enter from the outside but defile people, but I don't know that they can't do it. "Oto". Sunahachi food "Kura" Toilet cleanliness "Kiyoma" ... "

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 23 [# "23" is tate-chu-yoko] Lazaro [# middle heading end]

When Cristo heard Lazarus' death, he shed tears like never before. Never before-or tears that I haven't shown before. It is because of his sentimentalism that he came back to life from Lazarus' death. Why did he shed tears in front of Lazarus' sisters-Malta and Maria, who did not care for her mother Maria? Those who understand this contradiction are those who understand Christ's, or any Christ's genius ethics.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 24 [# "24" is tate-chu-yoko] Kana's feast [# middle heading end]

Although Cristo loved the woman, she did not care about dating with the woman. It is the same as allowing him to associate with the four women of Mohammet. None of them could cross an era-or society. However, it is certain that his heart, which loves freedom more than anything else, also moved there. Later superhumans needed to wear masks among the dogs. However, Cristo was inconvenienced in wearing a mask. The so-called "Ihayuru" and "Happiness of Rohen" * [# "Word + Mound Making", Level 4 2-88-74] "Lie" is of course obvious to him. American Christ, Hottmann, is still one of the people who chose this freedom. We often find Christ in his poems. Christ still laughs and looks down at Kiyauen, a feast of kana full of dancers, bouquets and musical instruments. But of course, instead of that, there must be his redemption, a little loneliness.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 25 [# "25" is tate-chu-yoko] Questions and answers on the mountain near the sky [# middle heading end]

Cristo talked to the Cristo who were born before him on a high mountain-Moose and Elijah. It is a more meaningful event than fighting the devil. A few days earlier he predicted to his disciples that he would go to Jerusalem and be crucified. Meeting his Moose and Elijah is evidence of his presence in some mental crisis. His face was "shining like the sun, and his clothes were white," not only because he was in front of the two Christs. He was the most solemn of his life at this time. His biographer does not record the questions and answers between them. But the question he posed was, "How should we live?" Christ's life is short. But at this time, he struck down the pain of having to make a full settlement of his life when he was thirty years old. Moose is a general who is good at strategy, as Napoleon said. Elijah is also more politically genius than Cristo. Not only that, today is not yesterday. Nowadays, if the waves of the Red Sea do not stand on the wall, the car of flames will not come from heaven. As Christ asked them, he couldn't help but feel that his unsightly death was approaching. On the mountain near the heavens, Iwamura's towers only rise in the light of the clear sun on the ice. However, at the bottom of the deep valley, pomegranate and figs can also be smelled. The smoke of the houses may have risen slightly there as well. Christo will probably not feel nostalgic for the life of the lower world. However, his way is toward the unpopular heaven, whether he dislikes it or not. The star that announced his birth-or the Holy Spirit that gave birth to him will not give him peace. "When you go down the mountain, Jesus tells them (Peter, James, and his brother John) that you should not tell others your brilliance until you are resurrected from the death of the Son of Man. The edge. "-It was only in his diary that he wanted to keep talking to Christ's" great dead "on the mountain near heaven.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 26 [# "26" is tate-chu-yoko] Like a young child [# middle heading end]

One of the paradoxes to Christ's teaching is, "I tell you, I'm not sure. If you don't look like a young child, you'll have to enter heaven." This word is not sentimental at all. Christo reveals in this word that he is closer to a young child than anyone else himself. At the same time, he reveals his own place as a child of the Holy Spirit. Goethe sang in his "Tatsusoo" the suffering of himself, also a child of the Holy Spirit. "Being like a little child" is something that goes into kindergarten. According to Christ's words, without the protection of someone, you cannot enter the Golden Gate except for those who are unbearable in life. His contempt for the world is also sneaking in there. His disciples were honestly [# "honestly" aside] (it is because of the hypocritical sentimentality of later generations that offends us in Christ's figure in front of a young child.) I couldn't go to the reason why I wasn't surprised by the little child who stood in front of me.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 27 [# "27" is tate-chu-yoko] To Jerusalem [# end of middle heading]

Cristo became a generation of prophets. At the same time, again, the prophet within himself-or the Holy Spirit who gave birth to him, began to play with him. We can also feel him in the moths burned by the candles. Moths are burned by candles because they were born into just one moth. Cristo is no different from a moth. Shiyo gives Cristo, who went to Jerusalem to be hung on the cross, a thunder-like sneer. But Christ carried his cross on his back before he drove a donkey to Jerusalem. It was a fate that he couldn't do anything about. He was also a genius there, and he was also a "child of man" in Tsuhi. Not only that, this fact teaches that it dominated Christ the centuries-old word "messiah." Christ, who ran a donkey on a tree-branched road, struck by the voice of "Hosana, Hosana," was himself and all the prophets of Israel. One of the Christs born after him tells us that he was struck by the regenerated Christ on the distant road of Looma, asking "Where are you going?" If Cristo couldn't go to Jerusalem, it would be that one of the prophets had asked, "Where are you going?"

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 28 [# "28" is tate-chu-yoko] Jerusalem [# middle heading end]

Cristo fought his last battle after hitting Jerusalem. It lacks water, but it is full of fierceness. He cursed the figs on the side of the road. Moreover, it was because he betrayed his expectation of figs and did not bear any fruit. He who has been gracious for everything is also here half-hysterically demonstrating his destructive power.
"Return Kaiser's stuff to Kaiser."
It is no longer the words of a passionate young man Christo. It is the words of an old adult Christo for his revenge on his life (he was, of course, a poet who valued heaven more than life). It is not always his wisdom that lurks there. It seems that he has been amiable to human folly who has never changed since the old days of Moose. However, his annoyance gave him Jehovah's "Hida" to expel those who went into the palace and bought and sold in it from the palace. , The idea of the silver man "Riyaugaherumono", and the sword "Hato" are defeated by the seller "Urumono" chair "Koshikake".
"This palace" Miya "is also broken now."
A woman poured perfume oil on his forehead for him. Christ ordered his disciples not to blame the woman. Then-Christ's feelings facing the cross sneak into the gentle words to those who don't understand him. He quietly spoke to them, smelling the perfume (it was no different from one of the rare events for him, who tended to be covered in dust).
"This woman poured me perfume to bury me. I can't always be with you."
Gethsemane's olivine is more tragic than Golgotha's cross. Christ was deadly and tried to fight with himself and the Holy Spirit within himself. Golgotha's cross gradually casts a shadow over him. He knew this fact and was angry. But his disciples-could not understand his feelings for Peter. Christ's prayer still has the power to approach us today. -
"My father, if you can do it, keep this cup from me. But if you say that there is no way to do it, please do it at your will."
Every Christ prays in the middle of the night when it's not popular. At the same time, all of Christ's disciples fall asleep in mourning without understanding his heartfelt feelings of "just dying." …………

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 29 [# "29" is tate-chu-yoko] Judas [# middle heading end]

The progeny will someday shine an evil circle on Judas. However, Judas is not necessarily the worst of the twelve disciples. Before raising the voice of Peter Sahe Garden Bird, he said he didn't know Christ three times. Selling Judas Iscariot is still the same as selling their leaders of today's politicians. Papini also counts the sale of Judas Iscariot as a big mystery. But Cristo was clearly in danger of being sold to anyone. The chief priests should have counted some Judas in addition to Judas. Judas has various conditions to become this tool. Of course, in addition to these conditions, it may have happened by chance. Later generations made Cristo a "child of God." It also led to the discovery of the devil in Judas himself. However, after selling Cristo, Judas hanged himself on the White Yang Tree. His discipleship with Christo-heard the voice of God, or may be seen there. Judas hated himself more than anyone else. Christ on the cross, of course, also afflicted him. However, the ridicule of the chief priests who used him also made him indignant. "It's good to do what you want."
Christ's words for Judas Iscariot are full of contempt and pity. "Son of Man" Christ may have felt Judas in himself or in Judas. But unfortunately Judas did not understand Christ's irony.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 30 [# "30" is tate-chu-yoko] Pilate [# middle heading end]

Pilate appeared by chance in Christ's life. He is just synonymous with Tsuhi. Later generations also give this official a legendary color. However, only Anatole France was not deceived by the colors.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 31 [# "31" is tate-chu-yoko] Barabbas than Cristo [# middle heading end]

Barabbas rather than Cristo-it's the same today. Barabbas appears to have attempted a rebellion. At the same time, he killed people again. However, they understand his work from the beginning. Niichie compared the later Barabbas to the dogs on the street. Of course, they felt hatred and anger at Barabbas's work. But in Christ's work-perhaps he didn't feel anything. If you feel something, you must feel it socially. Their spiritual slaves-the physically strong soldiers had Cristo bite a crown of thorns and put on a purple sword. , Shouted, "King of the Jews be safe." Christ's tragedy is miserable because it is in the midst of a comedy. Christ must have been the Jewish king mentally. But dogs who don't believe in genius-no, dogs who believe it's easy to find a genius ridicule the true Jewish king in the name of the Jewish king. Ke >> "Before the Landgrave's Tsukasa's strangeness, a word of Jesus was answered."-Christo wrote their question, "Jinmon", as the biographical author wrote. There is no answer to ridicule. Not only that, I couldn't answer anything. But Barabbas raised his head and answered everything clearly. Barabbas just rebels against his enemies. But Cristo rebels against himself-Maria within himself. It was a more radical rebellion than the Barabbas rebellion. At the same time, it was also a "human, too human" rebellion.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 32 [# "32" is tate-chu-yoko] Golgotha [# middle heading end]

Cristo on the cross had to be a "child of man" on the ridge.
"My God, my God, why do you abandon me?"
Of course, hero worshipers will sneer at his words. Those who are not children of the Holy Spirit or the situation only find "self-reliance" in his words. "Eri, Eri, Ramasa Bakutani" is effectively just a scream of Christ. But Cristo got closer to us because of this scream. Not only did he teach him the tragedy of his life more realistically.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 33 [# "33" is tate-chu-yoko] Pieta [# middle heading end]

Cristo's mother, the old Maria, is in front of Cristo's corpse. ――It cannot be said that it is sentimental to be called [Pie'ta] in the figure. The painters who want to draw Yui Pieta have to draw only Maria.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 34 [# "34" is tate-chu-yoko] Christ's friend [# middle heading end]

Cristo had twelve disciples. However, I didn't have any friends. If anyone had one, it was Joseph of Arimathea. "Come to Joseph of Arimathea, who is a noble councilor at nightfall. This person can see the kingdom of God [#" This person can see the kingdom of God ". He went to Pilate and begged for Jesus' corpse. -Mako, who is said to be older than Matthew, left a meaningful passage in his biography of Christ. This passage is completely different from the phrase, "Become a follower of Christ's disciples." Joseph is probably even more wisdom than Christ. He "goes to Pilate without hesitation and begs for Jesus' corpse" shows how deep his sympathy for Christ was. Well-educated lawmaker Joseph was frank at this time. The progeny are far colder to him than Pilate or Judas. But he knew him better than the twelve disciples. The one with John's neck on the plate is a cruelly beautiful salome. But after his death, Cristo counted Joseph of Arimathea among those who buried him. He finds happiness there more than John. If Joseph didn't become a member of the Diet, it might be good, even if he didn't have any "hitsukiya" questions like any "young .........". But he sometimes remembered his friend Christo under the figs and in front of the inlaid cup Sakazuki.

[# 5 indentation] [# middle heading] 35 [# "35" is tate-chu-yoko] Revival [# end of middle heading]

Renan saw Cristo's resurrection because of Mary Magdalene's imagination. For imagination-but it is Christ who has made a leap in her imagination. The mother, who lost her child, often sees his resurrection-reborn as something of him. He became a daimyo, a duck on a pond, or a lotus flower. But Cristo also shows himself after death outside of Maria. This fact shows how many people loved Christ. He was resurrected three days later. However, it took a longer time to move his lost world. For that reason, Paulo, a journalist who felt the genius of Christ all over his body, was the most powerful. As they crucified Cristo as they passed away for centuries, they acknowledged Cristo's resurrection as soon as they acknowledged the resurrection of Siexpia. However, it is certain that Christo after his death also reviewed the flow. The epidemic that dominates everything also dominates Christ. Clara's beloved Christ is not Pascal's respected Christ. But after Cristo's resurrection, making him an idol of the dogs-and swearing in the name of Cristo was no different. This is why he became his enemy to the Christs who were born after him. But in the same way, they could not help but see the Holy Spirit among their enemies on the way to Damascus.
"Saul, Saul, what do you hurt me for? Kicking a whip with thorns is by no means easy."
We are just ｜ standing in a life that is ridiculous. There is no reason outside of sleep that gives us peace. Every naturalist cruelly dissects this fact as a surgeon does. But the children of the Holy Spirit always left something beautiful on their lives. Something "something that tries to be super forever".

Of course, Cristo's life is a life that is passionate about the life of every genius. He was under the control of the Holy Spirit of his father rather than his mother Mary. The tragedy on his cross really exists there. One of the Christs born after him, Goethe, said, "I want to go to hell rather than getting old." However, he gradually grew older and became a mystic in his later years, as Strintberg said. The Holy Spirit lives in this poet by hanging with Mary. His "great pagan" name is not inevitable. He was really bigger than Christ on life [# "on top of life"]. Of course, it was bigger than the situation and other Christs. It seems that the star that announces his birth is more brilliant than the star that announces the birth of Christ. But it is not because of Maria's children that we love Goethe. Maria's children are also full in the wheat fields and on the chaise lounges. No, it often happens in the barracks, factories, and prisons. We love Goethe because we are children of the Holy Spirit. We will be with Christ someday in our lifetime. Goethe often pulls out Christ's beard in his poems. Christ's life was miserable. However, it symbolized the life of the children of the Holy Spirit born after him. (Actually, Goethe is no exception to this example.) Cristo religion may or may perish. At least it is constantly changing. But Christ's life always moves us. It is a ladder that broke miserably to climb from heaven to the ground. Hitting from the dim sky While leaning in the heavy pouring rain. ......

Niichie called religion "hygiene". It's not just religion. Morality and economy are also "hygiene". They will keep us healthy from the beginning to the death. "Touhou people" usually tried to put this "hygiene" on top of Nirvana. Laozi sometimes greets the town of Mukai with the Buddha. However, we cannot distinguish the east and west from the color of the skin. This is what drives Cristo's--or the Cristo's lifelong us. The song "Returning to the ancient hero's hero, Sana" has always been passed down to us. However, the voice of "Heaven is approaching" cannot help standing us. Laozi asks the younger Confucius, or Christo of China. A savage life always afflicts Christs a little. The "people of the east" who wished to become Taihei's human beings are no exception to this example. Christ said, "The fox has a hole. The bird in the sky has a nest. But the human child has no place to pillow." His words are probably unconscious of himself, and contain terrifying facts. We cannot easily find a roost outside of becoming a fox or a bird.
