Dear sister * [# "Sister" orthodox character, "Woman + * [# 3rd level 1-85-57] making", 225-2] and others.
The members of the National Assembly of India have made a serious resolution on September 30th to thoroughly carry out a foreign-made fabric non-buying alliance. This non-buying alliance began with a sacrificial fire in Bombay last July 31st to commemorate Rocamanya Chirak. I have been given the privilege of igniting a pile of noble Saturdays and other garments that you have considered to be magnificent and beautiful. I'm * [# "sister" orthodox, "woman + * [# 3rd level 1-85-57] making", 225-7] It is correct and wise for my sisters to throw out their expensive clothing. I think it was. Discarding that garment was the most economical use you could have taken advantage of. This is because abandoning an infectious disease-attached item is the most economical and most useful use of it. It is the surgery needed to prevent the more serious plague of the nation.
The Indian lady has done an amazing job for her home country in the past year. You worked silently as angels of mercy. I let go of cash and fine gemstones. I made a door-to-door visit to collect donations. Some of you have been the ones who supported the lookout. Also, the beautiful kimonos that have been used so far * [# "厂" instead of "广" in "Matoi", 226-3] Then, I use pure white but heavy domestic cotton clothes to remind me of the innocence peculiar to women. You have all done these things for India, for Kirafatsuto, for Panjatub. There is nothing to blame for what you have done. Your actions are the purest sacrifice that is not tainted by anger or hatred. I want to confess to you that this natural, aesthetically pleasing dew of all Indians has firmly believed in me that God is with us. The fact that the innocent Indian women are willing to help is the proof that our sword is a self-reliance.
We have received a great deal of help from you, but now we need to get even more help. The boys have defeated most of the distribution to the Swaraj Foundation. However, the completion of the self-government "Swaraj" plan is possible only after you have the greatest pre-distribution. If [# "Young" is an emphasis mark], unless you are throwing out all of the foreign clothing [# "If you are not throwing out all of the foreign clothing"], Non-buying alliances are impossible [# "Non-buying alliances are impossible"] [# "Non-buying alliances" is basically "non-buying alliances"]. As long as foreign clothing is in good shape, there will be no complete refusal. And the non-buying alliance [# "What is a non-buying alliance" is basically "What is a non-buying alliance"] means a complete refusal. We must be grateful for the children that God gives us, and we must be able to add to the clothing produced by India. No matter how ugly a child looks to the eyes of others, no mother throws away her babies. A patriotic Indian woman must have the same attitude when it comes to Indian products. Only products that are hand-spun and hand-woven may be considered as Indian products. In the transitional period, you can only get Kaday in Shitomi. You will come to add to it the decorations that your hobby allows or that your hobby requires. And if you spend a couple of months suffocating with a poor caddy, then you will soon have the envy of the world and the fine, beautiful kimono of the old days that was the target of its disappointment. It will come out to put it in. If we endure for six months, what we consider to be artistic today is not only formal, but because we misunderstand it. , It seems that it is important to emphasize what is behind the shape. In the world, there are arts that kill life, and there are arts that kill life. The fine textiles imported from the West or the Far East are literally our hundreds of brothers * [# "sister" orthodox, "woman + * [# 3rd level 1-85-57] making", 228-2] Killing my sister, a thousand of us loved * [# "sister" orthodox, "woman + * [# 3rd level 1-85-57] making", 228-2] sister It led to a shameful life. The art of truth must represent the happiness, suffocation and chastity of the creator. And if you want to revive the art that takes place between us [# "you are" in the bottom line, "you are"], in this case most of you use Kaday. Must be.
Also, in order to achieve the plan of autonomy, it is not only necessary to use Kaday, but it is absolutely necessary for you to spin the sword in your spare time without leaving alone. I screamed at the children and boys as well. Thousands of people are spinning every day. You must be negative in the heavy hand-spun negatives as in the old days. Two hundred years ago, Indian women not only spun to meet domestic demand, but also to foreign demand. They spun not only the poorest products, but also the most respectable ones in the world. No matter what kind of machine we used, we couldn't find the beautiful 絲 that our ancestors spun in the past. So, if we try to meet the demand of Kaday for two months and beyond, you will create a spinning club, open a spinning co-promotion meeting, and hand-spun silk. We have to unify the Indian market. To achieve this goal, some of you must be proficient in spinning, combing, and using spinning wheels. This is an uninterrupted work. You do not consider spinning as a means of living. But for the middle class, it supplements the income of the family, and for the very poor women, it is undoubtedly a means of life. The spinning wheel must always be the widow's good companion. But for those of you who read this sentence, it is obligatory and placed as daruma (faith). If the rich Indian women spin some crabs every day, the value of the crabs will be cheaper and the necessary elaborate products will be supplied quickly.
The economic and spiritual salvation of India is mainly on your shoulders. [# "It's ゐ" is "It's ゐ" in the bottom line] The Indian prince lies on your lap. After all, you are the ones who nurture the undeveloped nations. You can raise Indian children into naive, god-fearing, brave men and women, or spoil them and never break through the rough seas of life. [# Instead of "广" in "Matoi", "厂", 229-11] Then, later on, it is possible to make it a weak human being who cannot even think of it. It will be clear in the coming weeks what abilities Indian women have. I have no doubt about what choices you make. The fate of India is far safer in your hands than in the hands of the government that exploited this wealth source to the point of desperation in India.
I prayed that you would congratulate this national effort in all the ladies' associations. For you believe that your chastity, your sincerity, and your godliness will give you a tight and effective blessing. You can be confident that your blessings will bring about a brilliant fruit by abandoning foreign-made garments and spinning for the nation in your spare time.
