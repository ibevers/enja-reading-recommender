[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
Health (1) [# "(1)" is a small note on the right side of the line] / "\ Don't say it!
The mistake of health (1) [# "(1)" is written on the right side of the line] is more damaging than the sacrifice of health.
Is there such a big obstacle to our joint work!

Which one can do more work?
Are we sitting in prison or you who are enduring persecution outside prison?
We always loved your mistakes, simplicity and passion
We seriously expected the results of your work when you were released from prison
In order for us to stick and go through after that!

But
Those who do not make mistakes to avoid work, those who masturbate to detect responsibility by making a difference, and those who use sneaky swords for self-rationalization and promotion
Revolutionary parasites --- Curse on Lumpenproletariat!

As one of the tens of millions of steel judges who know no conversion
Declare on behalf of unhappy comrades who have been informed of their health
"Throw stones first, innocent in you!"
[# End of indentation here]

(1) Conversion
