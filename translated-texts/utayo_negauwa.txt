"Song", Negafu seeks the god of "love"
The companion song is in front of you.
"Song" is my own word, and the Lord "Shiyu" is Kano-kun.
He finds himself in a terrifying, no-fear, straight-eyed Masami and talks about it.

If it becomes a "song" that is attentive to "Iya", it's okay.
Alone
There's nothing terrifying about it,
Rest assured, my heart |
God of "love"
Beside it with the guardian, "Back",
Kano-kun is the leaf of the word "song"
At that time, I was indignant, and I couldn't solve it.
The obsession of "love" with the helper "Tsukurohi"
Immediately, the shame of contempt is apparent.

"Song", the key "Shirabe" is beautiful and accompanies "love"
Tell me,
After begging Kano-kun for "Aharemi"
"My prince, the one who only sends me
Ihikeraku,
This wording "Kotohiraki" is a listening twist.
Behold, "love" is colored by you
Let the person's color change as you wish,
Also, ponder the other lady, Iratsume,
The true heart of the bottom of the thought "Omohi" moves to Tsuhi. "

Also to the song, "My heart, his heart
Believe
There is no other heart to serve you,
I'm going to return to you from Tsuto. " Kate Naho
Doubt is ゞ
Repeatedly to the song, "To love" is the quality.
At the end, you should play gracefully
"This my wish" Negahi "
Or rather he will die,
I'm acting for you, but I'm a dreamer. "
Before leaving, he also asks for a pitiful key.
Call "love"
Begging me to state my thoughts
"If you let me say the key of this" song ""
Kano's
Perched on the other side
Thus, that request, "That Negahi", is yours.
Show me the beautiful sword. "
No, no, my "song", if you have a heart
Give me a song and a tribute to the song.
