★

In the middle of the clear sky like steel
The moon is sobbing.
……… The shadow of the irritating earth
When I move to my face …………
If you can see it from a lot of people …………
………… I hate it because I'm swaying.

★

………However………
The dark fate that cannot be escaped …………
It approaches her every moment.
In the middle of the sky …………

★

……started……
Lunar eclipse …………

★

She somehow showed her death.
Watery raw white cheeks …………
…… The invisible hair was pulled up to the horizon for a long time …………
It's cold ... beautiful ... transparent ...
The water from around the temples ………… drips.

★

She is already …………
Give up if there is no help for it
Dark ………… In the hands of an ugly fate …………
It seems that he intends to leave his beauty to him.

★

The area around the chin
It is cut out a little.
………… Black blood springs up.
………… The dark scent of Namagusa flows into the sky.
………… It spreads all over to the horizon.
The light of the stars surrounding her was glaring.

★

Her eyelids shook all the way
Eventually, the black will come to life without power.
Black blood * [# "Stone + Demon", 4th level 2-82-48] "Clump" rises next to the nose.
………… Thanks to the deeply cut blade 《Yaiba》
The reddish-brown meat is hikumeku.

★

The world has darkened.
All living things are as heavy as lead
A painful heart like a needle
I hugged it and got stuck.

★

But it's dark ... the circular blade that cuts better than steel
Her pale side cheeks
Still slashing with Zunsun.
The darkness that overflows from there ………… Everything drowns in the smell of the scent.
………… Mountains ………… Seas ………… Forests ………… Houses ………… Roads …………
………… Some people are looking up from there …………

★

The only white light that remains in it …………
Her forehead and nose streaks
A little more …………
I was almost covered by the black blade "Yaiba".

★

A terrifying star all over the sky
Whisper in a small voice
It calmed down again.

★

The last time of misery …………
Under the blood that covers the face
The white eyelids that were closed with the idea
Patchuri and she opened.

★

With an unexpectedly calm face
I looked around the people of the lower world
I smiled with a smile.

★

………… Hohohohohohoho ……
This is a play.
…… The shadow and light of the sky …….
That's why the concubine "I" is painful and painful ...
…… Nothing …………
Then it will be over soon.

★

………… But everyone really did.
...... I'm a great actor ...
Ohohohohoho ………………

★

Goodbye …………
good night everyone.
…… Hohohohoho ……………………
Hohohohoho ………………………………
