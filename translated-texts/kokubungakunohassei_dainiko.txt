Development of spells
One God's bride
By the time the national consciousness emerged, the priest was a close relative of a high-class shrine maiden in most Japanese shrine maidens. At the same time, it is the territory of our imagination, and even in the newer era that seems to be history, there are still many shrine maidens who are recognized as the sovereigns of Naho villages and countries. It was.
[# Indent from here]
Empress Jingu is that. This is the reason why there are many empresses in ancient times. Perhaps some of the people who were considered to be male sovereigns were actually women who lived as shrine maidens. There is a lot of regret about this point. Himiko, a Wei book that is easily considered as one with Empress Jingu, had her magical ability as a shrine maiden, which kept her in the position of a nation in Kitakyushu.
[# End of indentation here]
The high-class shrine maidens in the villages were single in principle. Because it was promoted as the bride of God. At the time of the god festival, the god appears through the men of each person to the fundamental idea that men and women in the crowd become ecstatic and fall into a mess.
[# Indent from here]
Utagaki, which was made into a song among the citizens of the Nara dynasty, is actually a different thing, but it seems that it was passed down to posterity of the remains of the Utagaki. 1-15-93] It is a well-established theory that this is also the "small gathering" of Sumiyoshi "Sumi Noe" in addition to the poetry "Kahi" (Togoku).
[# End of indentation here]
Therefore, it seems that the current god, Akitsukami, usually sleeps with a lower-ranking shrine maiden who is the bride of the god. Even in the Heian dynasty, the wind was still present in the old local companies.
The national structure of Izumo and Munakata-the name of the old forbidden national structure was still called "Naho", but it was only to show the history of the priest, and it was separated from the administration. Forbidden to commit "Uneme" (third generation of Kinju) is a reminder of the life of the priests of the villages before the Nara dynasty. Uneme is thought to be the one who controls the food for Tenshi, but in reality, she is a low-ranking shrine maiden who is concerned with the god and the current god "Akitsukami".
[# Indent from here]
The daughter of the gunji of the nations was accused by the uneme of the court and returned to the palace. It can be presumed that the purpose was to let the god of the gods do things, and to pass on the fruits of religious practice and ritual unification to the counties of the old territory. It was not as a god and as a person that the current god slept with the uneme. If the legend of the Japanese human sacrifice sees that some seeds have been found, one can think of a woman (not something that can be eaten) that is advanced to God from this side.
[# End of indentation here]
For this reason, the example of becoming Mrs. Uneme's wife is reported in a surprising literature. The story of a Korean (Japanese) who was suspected of committing the uneme by making a song in memory of Miyama with "Unemehaya. Miehaya" by Emperor Ingyō also stole the bride of this god. It should be considered as a blame as a person. This shows the existence of the Droit du Seigner in Japan and the reason for it. The third-generation sentence to Izumo and Munakata was a rational policy and a cultural facility that tried to separate the god from the present god to the private sector, even though the old-fashioned one existed only in the court.
When the gods coming from you in the sky or the sea are considered on the spirits of the features, the distinction between high and low is also made on the gods. Gods who come from afar often become the center of worship in the villages. It seems that there were many gods on this side who could be promoted by the bride, who is also called "Tsuishiro". The god who set the time had a shrine maiden, even though it was rarely seen. For those who dressed as gods at the usual god festival, the affairs as a bride of gods have not changed. This seems to have led to the village festival and the house festival.
Two Marebito
The regular guest invited to the newly built room "Muro" Hogi [# "Hogi" sideline] was unusually respected.

Is not a tatami banquet. I think that it was made when the old custom of leaving the body of Maihime "Mahihime" to the regular customer of the room "Muro" Hogi [# "Hogi" sideline], when it began to collapse. Swell.
[# Indent from here]
When Emperor Ingyō faced the Empress's room "Muro" Hogi [# "Hogi" sideline], he forced his sister, Tsuyoshi Muro, who was a dancer, to his older sister who was reluctant to proceed. There is a story (Japanese period). Even the envious empress is rooted in deep-rooted folklore to the tradition that she could not refuse it.
When Kumebe [# (No)] Kogure was invited to the new room of Shimi 《Shimi》 [# (No)] Fine 《Hosome》, he was invited to dance as a dancer. It should be seen from this side that the king's ass was trashed. The fact that a regular guest of Murohogi [# "Murohogi" is on the sidelines], who is revered as a god, hears the lyrics of King Hirokazu "Woke" and suddenly slips down, also blames this. I have to think about it.
[# End of indentation here]
The word "Marebito" [# "Marebito" is a sideline] actually has a deep content. The regular guests who came to the room "Muro" Hogi [# "Hogi" sideline] were rarely considered to be a substitute for the visiting god. Perhaps the regular guest, after chanting the spell, was accepted and went straight to the feast. Even now, in the countryside of Okinawa, I believe that architecture is made by people during the day and by gods at night. On the day of building up, the god falls into the house, rings the kane, and beats the pillars. It is said that the sound can be heard in the ears of the family members who are lying prostrate outside the mansion. Of course, this is what the shrine maidens do.
In the Yaeyama Islands, the gods and rituals who attend village festivals and house festivals wrap their faces and other parts in Basho and Kuba leaves, and use the voice and gestures of the gods. Jump with the epic of God. It is an event at the festival grounds in the village. Also, when you stand at the door of your house, you will sing a spell and bless you from now on. From the bottom of the earth to the god of the giant who faces the coming-of-age ceremony once a year, from the land of your Pure Land Maya [# alongside "Maya"] in the sea, to the houses of the grain god who comes to bless farming A group of ancestors who sing and dance with lessons learned with a few or more than a dozen genus, all showing the old blessing of negotiations between the god who descends at a fixed time and the spells and plays. I'm here.
On half of the main island of Okinawa, the gods come to the summer sea deity festival, which is still going on, from the [# "Niraikanai" sideline] that does not go to your pure land in the sea. The god of the country, the mountain god [# "the god of the mountain", is on the sidelines] comes to the reception. It is an annual example to perform sea fishing and mountain hunting while singing an old epic poem at a village festival ground.
This is the god festival of the islands of Okinawa, which is believed to keep the life of the Manyo people to a certain point. There are many examples in the mainland where human beings have gradually forgotten the gods' works that come to the teachings, such as the blessing of production during the year and the ease of changing the seasons.
Sekizoro, which had disappeared before the Meiji era, wore a knitted hat with fern leaves on a cloth that wraps his face, rang four bamboos, and danced at the gates of the houses at the end of the year. The phrase "the weather in the season" is the voice of God who gave the passage of time and the attention of farming. The congratulatory message of Hurray and Monoyoshi [# Aside from "Monoyoshi"] shows a long tradition that has been repeated both as a god and as a god.
[# Indent from here]
"Onkoto, who is under the tree of Sai, is an abbreviation for thinking about this year." From the samurai's congratulatory message, which seems to be a change in the question and answer with God, the private sector, "Naru or Nana. Looking at the events of New Year's Eve and Setsubun night, it is a direct conversation between a person and a spirit rather than a spell or a word. From a point of view, it looks like a god who hangs on a spirit. At the same time, this is irrelevant. It is also known as the example of hurray and Saizo.
[# End of indentation here]
The Saizo that comes with Hurray is probably from the "Sai Man". Also, it seems to be pronounced as Seino [# "Seino" is a sideline], and it is sometimes written as Seino. However, in this case, it is like a doll. A talented man [# beside the "talented man"] can be a person. In the Kagura of the inner samurai, after the "Mai of the Chief Ninjiyau", there is a "Sake Ichi | Zun" and a "Talented Man" (depending on the Eke). This was a kind of sarugaku, a humorous impersonation. However, there is a company that has a doll blue farm as the center of the festival. In particular, dolls were often used at Yawata-affiliated companies. The Kagura song that is handed down today seems to belong to the Iwashimizu system. In this school of Kagura, a talented man [# aside from the "talented man"] At the same time, it seems that he played Sarugaku on a doll in Seino.
The talented man [# beside the "talented man"] initially impersonates God and appears to represent God, but when the object of worship improves, he is left behind without the character of God. Natsuta. Therefore, it seems that God's proclamation was translated into human language, and it was transferred to the movement of human beings to play the role of a messenger of God's word. From the place where the suggestion of God is embodied, a humorous impersonation of Sarugaku style can be produced, and God does [# sideline to ""], and a talented man aside [# sideline to "side". ], And it seems that an opponent has appeared. The Nogaku "Waki Kyogen", which is the source of Kyogen, has become a meaningless thing today, and it has become a ridiculous thing outside of the old-fashioned way of treating the sights as incompetent people. It is not something that focuses on [# aside from "narrative"], but it is a humorous, Ning "rather" that shows the true essence of "Sarugaku", the old essence of Nogaku. It should have been. The narrative of Shinto ritual Noh [# sideline to "narrative"] was biased toward interesting "shuramono" at the request of the samurai family.
The content is gradually improved, and the format is renewed from the place where it was left in the old days to the top. This is also the reason why Kyogen and Kyogen [# "Kashi" on the sideline] are now attached under the side [# "Waki" on the sideline].
There is also a clown in "Niwaka", "Chaban", and "Daikagura", and he repeats the ridiculous ridiculous [# "Odoke" sideline]. The sedoka that I mentioned earlier plays a role in this form, but even before that, it seems that the content was a reversal. Repeatedly asking questions, is it the end of the lyrics? ! It is the usual form of oracle to answer with the effort to replace it.
Three others
It is said that chanting the sword is loosened [# "hogu" is a sideline]. Homu [# "Homu" is a sideline] is also a word that has the same word origin and unifies term examples. Homu [# "Homu" sideline] can be taken as a mere praise today, but from the point of blessing in advance and stating the best possible condition, the righteousness of praise is differentiated. It was. It seems that Tafu [# "Tafu" sideline], which crawls into the same term, is a word that came out much later. It is a prayer to expect a peaceful appearance that is about to overflow. It seems that this term example has been fixed since the adjective "Taehashi" was created. It seems that he doesn't say praise [# "praise" is a sideline] because he wants to praise him.
Reuse and say other fu [# "other fu" sideline], idioms and say "koto (word) hogu" [# "koto (word) hogu" sideline] Gu "on the sideline] had more original meaning than Homu [# "Homu" on the sideline]. It wasn't just a celebration. "Ho", such as "Hada Usuho [#" Ho "on the sidelines] ..." (Jingu Jingu), "appears on the surface" after being used exclusively for love songs. It is said that "it appears in the complexion". At the same time, it is said that it appears in a symbolic expression like a fortune-telling elephant (Urakata) as an uncaptured shadow of the suggestion of the gods. If you look at the end (Ura) and Hide (Ho) in contrast, you can get a rough idea. Words such as "Ocher's ho [#" ho "on the sideline]" are also words that refer to the word "ho" that is indicated by ocher, and are a symbol of divine will. It may have been said that chanting the lyrics to accompany this "ho" was called "hogu" [# "hogu" is a sideline], but as a process before this, God called "ho". I think that it came through the meaning of saying to show. As far as the literature appears, the meanings of unraveling [# "hogu" on the sideline] include Ukehi [# "Ukehi" on the sideline] and Uranahi [# "uranahi" on the sideline]. It seems to be terrible.
Suppose something happens that draws some attention. The old man tried to know the suggestion by using this as the "ho" of God. There was an incident in which a goose laid an egg on the bank (or Himeshima) of Ibarata (Mamuda), and Takenouchi no Sukune said that it was a song (Kiki). When the territory is struck by Tsuhi, the geese are like a child-produced "com", which is a part of the Hogi song. With the spawning of the everlasting geese, he saw the emperor's immortal life as the "ho" and made a kotohogi [# aside from the "kotohogi"]. It is probable that Norito and the word "congratulatory words" came out as the name of the oral sentence that says "Kotohogi" [# "Kotohogi" is a sideline]. The original meaning goes through the transition of the dust that I wrote in the first. Yuihogu [# Aside from "Hogu"] It seems to be true that the target was life.
[# Indent two characters from here]
The god of combs, I'm in the everlasting world, the god of the small name "Sukuna bi kona", "Cam", Hoki, Hokikuruho, Toyohoki, Hokimotohoshi, and the festival's sake "Ki". )
[# End of indentation here]
The song of Sake et al. [# "Sake et al." Is a sideline] shows that it also serves as a fortune-telling congratulatory message for life. Miko climbing up from Tsuruga | Shinda Wake "Homdawake" was brewed and placed in order to occupy the body. Success or failure may be judged by overnight sake or porridge. This also occupies the health of travelers depending on the quality of sake. When I got home, I was grateful for drinking the sake.
Sake et al. [# Aside from "Sake et al."] Is not just sake. Say the ritual of the first word to brew sake [# aside from "word"]. Somehow, it looks like a celebration to make sake, a prayer for good work, but it doesn't hit. "... Masura Ou no Hogu [#" Hogu "on the sideline] Toyo Sake, I'm Hinikeri" (Oshinki) is in the form of Hogishi [# "Hogishi" on the sideline] in the form of time abbreviation. is there. This is a customary form of waiting sake, and it is a fortune-telling that uses the beginning of sake brewing to fortune-telling the longevity of Kotohogi [# alongside "Kotohogi"]. When this part is gradually dismissed, the direction of praying for fermentation well becomes one form of Kotohogi [# "Kotohogi" is a sideline]. The word "Sake et al." [# Aside from "Sake et al."] Is the reason why it approaches the meaning of a banquet. The change was in every direction, as well as in [# "other line"]. However, since sake originally originated from Shinto ritual, it cannot be said that the use of fortune-telling at the starting point is not considered.
On the side of Murohogi [# sideline to "Murohogi"], this causal relationship is mixed. The syllabary of King Murohogi [# "Murohogi" is a sideline] is probably a phrase that was commonly used by the general public. He lives the life of the patriarch by writing lyrics to each part of the building. The pillars are the calming of the heart, the beams are the prosperity of the heart, the liquor is the preparation of the heart, and the 蘆 * [# "Making of the Mind", Level 4 2-91-83] "Etsuri" is the peace of mind. Gi, Katsune "Tsunane" is a firm life, and the buds are a hymn that describes the history of the sake that is currently in use, after the phrase that says that it indicates an excess of wealth "Amari". It is a variant of Hi [# "Sake et al." After that, I conclude with the whispering sentence of "My long-lived people" Tokoyo "(normal age)" (Kensouki). Here, too, the relationship between Murohogi [# "Murohogi" is a sideline] and the longevity of life can be seen.
When trying to change their lives by building a new building, they try to determine the fate of the patriarch. This is a substance that is placed in contrast to life, but it seems that it is not included in the thought of fortune-telling. The only thing that exists is Majinahi [# aside from "Majinahi"] that comes from the metaphor.
It seems that even if it is not a newly built house, it is possible to handle it in the same way as the new room by using the word hogi [# "Kotohogi" sideline]. Since it is not possible to build a new room in Niiname-no-ya or any other place every year, the Great Hall Festival "Ohotonohokahi" that doubles as a room hogi [# "Murohogi" sideline] to the Harae "Hara" I also made something like a congratulatory message. Prior to the ceremony, at the annual Niiname-no-Kamishoku "Jinkonjiki" and Daijosai, Norito goes around the shrine, which is indispensable for the normal life of Tenshi, and Mihogi-no-tama [# "Mihogi-no-tama"" at the four corners. I walked to sing the congratulatory words. Mihogi [# aside from "Mihogi"] is a blessing that a person prepares in advance the suggestion of fate that God should express, so in this case, the ball is used as a god. It wasn't. Izumo Kokuzo Kamigaji's metaphors such as "Shiratama's Great White Hair, Akatama's Sapphire, Aotama's Mizue no Tama no Yuki Ahi, Aki Tsumikami and Oyashima Kuni Shiroshimesu ..." It contains.
Four yogoto
The reason why Kotobuki has completely entered the terminology of the old word "Yogoto" is that the court events have a tendency to make Tenshi's life at every opportunity. It cannot be said that the private spell was only for the purpose of praying for the health and happiness of the patriarch. There are many spells that simply try to bring about effects in agriculture, construction, labor, etc.
It can be seen that the example of the chief vassal playing the sword "Yogoto" on behalf of the head of the county vassal every year continued until the Nara dynasty. The character is addressed to "Kashoji", but it is still yogoto [# sideline to "yogoto"]. My family's "Today's Furuyuki no Iya Frequently". Yogoto [# "Yogoto" ni Sideline] "(Manyo Maki 20) will play the longevity forever due to the effect of this longevity. As much as they receive it, they say that they will have a long life. Also, in "For a Thousand Years, Tanushiki Complete" (20th volume of ancient and modern times), not only do you think about the joy of the New Year's party, but you can also believe in the longevity of Tenshi's longevity by means of the sushi. It is a rich expectation of a person who has a long life. In the olden days, it is thought that the representatives of each of the songs of each of the powerful tribes came out and said the traditional syllabary "Yogoto", which was similar to the lyric "Sinubigoto". The wording is somewhat similar to Nakatomi Tenjin Toshi and Kaga. I think that it is a good idea to express only the hope of prolonging life in a straightforward manner.
The oldest spell was God's aspiration, promise, and extortion, under the belief that it was invaded by the oracle. The power of God's spell was carefully and secretly handed down as something that would never die. That is what is called "the thick glue of the heavenly seaweed" and the word "goto". A part of the text contains the old spell of this god, in the congratulatory words of Mr. Abe and the congratulatory words of Ise Jingu and Nakatomi.
Especially, it is the congratulatory words of the fire extinguishing festival that reminds me of its old appearance.

It is tied with. The part in it is the heavenly congratulatory word. From the history of the god of fire, if the violence is struck, the god has given him a way to prevent it. He also knows the weaknesses of the god of fire. It is a phrase that preaches that even the existence of water, gourd, sardines, and river vegetables as its enemies is understood by the consideration of the Mother Goddess. Because of the divine word, it threatens the weaknesses of the spirits. This congratulatory word is the oldest of the existing congratulatory words, and I wonder if it indicates the sword of the long-lived word "yogoto" other than the age word "yogoto". However, the times are far behind for words other than the heavenly congratulatory words.

[# End of indentation here]
Such words are old-fashioned, but the expressions are immature. I can't find anything so old-fashioned. It retains enough of the old form of response.
The congratulatory words that refer to other heavenly swords and [# "sideline to heavenly swords"] do not retain the scent so much that it seems that they did not show that part because they all had heavenly congratulatory words. It is a thing. The heavenly congratulatory words that seemed to be Oharae congratulatory words are probably omitted in the text, but some of them seem to show off their traditions in order to hide the spirits, or they are impure. From the motive, it seems that he tried to set the era for the transmission of the congratulatory words of my family.
The heavenly congratulatory spells are the oldest, and many of them have lost their folklore. Shigetane Suzuki says that the so-called three-kind congratulatory word is "Emi Takagi" [# "Emi Takagi" is a sideline], but Emi Takagi [# "Emi Takagi" is a sideline]. It is a seed.
Five heavenly congratulatory words
It seems that various things are also hot in the heavenly congratulatory words. Even in the congratulatory words of the fire extinguishing festival, the insertion part is quite different from that of Emi Takagi [# "sideline to Emi Takagi"]. This congratulatory word, which includes the heavenly congratulatory word and crawls into the thoughts of the singer, is from the second period. It is an old shoujo that the previous form is grouped under the name of Tentsu Norito. The form of the third period and below is based on the idea that the power as a spell is generated by transferring the figure of God's sword. The creator is the current god "Akitsukami" who is the immediate priest. The fourth period was the time when Emperor Tenmu had a representative of the spell in the court of the largest current god.
In "Kametsusaibun (quoted from Shaki), you can see the name of Taikodo" Futonorito "[# (No)] life, and in Kametsuden, you can see Kametsuhime" [# ( No)] The other name of life is Tianjin Shodo Taishoto << Amatsu Norito Futonorito >> [# (No)] Life. At first glance, it looks like a god of fortune-telling. If you go one step further, you will say that it is a god that belongs to the three kinds of congratulatory words. Thinkingly, Kametsu Hime [# (No)] life is a god of turtles. Taikodo [# (No)] Life is the god of general heavenly congratulations, and Kametsu Hime [# (No)] Life is the god of the spell of a part of it, "Togami Emi". I don't know. This god is a god of congratulations, and it seems that he could think of both one pillar and two pillars. If this idea were to be taken into consideration, what would Taishodo [# (ノ)] life have in relation to the swords and congratulatory words?
Judging from the content of the congratulatory words, the first dictator of the spell seems to be the life of Kaburoki [# "Kaburoki" on the sideline] and Kaburomi [# "Kaburomi" on the sideline]. At the same time, this is a mere legend, and there must be many gods who started oral teaching before they could return so much. However, it seems that he leaned toward the powerful god from the place where he respected the ancientity of the tradition. Tianjin Shodo Taishoto [# (No)] It is unknown from what time the life was considered to be a god with a certain function in all old spells.
From the spirit of transmitting the divine language, the god of the spell itself is considered, and the existence of a god who defends the power of the spell and prevents oblivion is also needed. In this sense, it seems that a god with a mysterious name called Taikodo [# (No)] life was also enshrined. Besides that, there are now two ways to think about it. It is possible that the first god of the spell dictation, the god that often appears on the spell, the deification of the power of the spell immediately, and the deification.
As the god of turtles, I asked why Kamezu Hime, who was enshrined in Urabe of Iki's Urabe clan, had a relationship with the congratulatory words, and asked for an explanation of the negotiations between the congratulatory words and the fortune-teller. Become. It seems that not only the three types of congratulatory words, but also the shoujo and congratulatory words are often related to fortune-telling. There were many sides that belonged to fortune-telling, such as Sake et al. [# "Sake et al." The "ho" that God indicates is a metaphorical expression. If we look at the original meaning of unraveling [# aside from "hogu"] to guarantee the fate of another thing with the current state of one thing, one will see the "ho" as favorable as possible. Nozomi. Inevitably, the prayer is accompanied by a question about what will happen. I have a presumption that the priest's duties gave birth to a magical curse. Magic is a fortune-telling art.

Stand up this tamagushi, and from the setting sun to the rising sun, declare it as a thick seaweed with heavenly seaweed. If this is the case, the elephant "Machi" will come out in a hurry. From below, Yai of the heavens "Ame" comes out. …… (Toshiji Nakaomi)
[# End of indentation here]
Looking at it in this way, it is known that there are two types of spells, one that produces immediate results and the other that the "ho" that reserves the results appears while chanting. The next thought that arises is the idea of ​​trying to squeeze the divine will with the metaphor of the expected result.
To put it in terms of the order of occurrence from the top of the content, the heavenly glue and the kind of [# "Tentsurito" alongside the line] take a direct expression for the result. It is the second term of the sword that comes to require unraveling [# "hogu" on the sidelines]. The third period is to lean toward fortune-telling from the "ho" of God, while connecting artificial "ho" on the language to bring about happy results. There are many of these kinds of spells in Japan, and it seems that they were brought to the Norito. To put it in terms of the outer era, by the time the current priest, the priest, produces the Norito as a god's statement, there are many things that fall within this range. The creations of the fourth period spellwriters are significantly utilitarian. As the current god thought fades, the prayer that is derived from the thought as a human being is simply made to God.
Six seriously
The spell takes a metaphorical expression, and a serious line [# "Majinahi" is a sideline] comes out from the place that drives the divine will. The Mihogi no Tam [# "Mihogi no Tam" sideline] is already in this range. In particular, it is the Kagami verse that has a lot of Majinahi [# "Majinahi" alongside] on the language. The sacred treasures of Mihogi have meaning one by one. Shiratama, Akatama, Aotama, Yokoto, Hakuba, Hakuba "Kuihi", Yabun "Shidori", Wakamizu Numama "Wakaminuma", Mirror is a metaphor, and auspicious lyrics continue. These are more abstractly extended from the metaphor above the name. The more the metaphors that have been passed down since ancient times, the more concrete and close they are. Joban and Kenban actually came from the ancient Murohogi [# "Murohogi" sideline], and saw similarities between the bedrock "Tokiha" and wall rock "Kakiha" and the solidity of life. It is.
The words such as "Tsunane", which is the heavenly eighty-kage (the heavenly and the sun-like), are the ropes of the kudzu "katsura" that hangs down from the ridge of Minaya. After all, the embryo was born in Murohogi [# "Murohogi" sideline]. From that long point, it has been used for a long time in life, as well as for [# "other line"]. From the strength of the vitality of the mulberry tree, the common word "Ikashihachi" ya "mulberry branch" can be made. These are not simple metaphors that modern people think of, but because of the charm of those things, there was a time when magic was performed. They try to rash the object by the power of those substances to infect others.
It uses the same infectivity, but there is another cause where the result appears in a mixed manner. To the thought of the language spirit. The theory of the existence of spirits hidden in human language, which has been called unlimitedly in the past, must be conditioned to a certain point. He believed that it was only found in oracles and gods, something that was not found in everyday dialogue that appeared in prose style. Tayodo [# (No)] Imagine that life is a god in this sense, as I mentioned earlier. Kotodama [# "Kotodama" sideline] is a spirit hidden in the oracle text, rather than a language spirit.
By the way, the word "Kotodama" Sakihafu [# "Sakihafu" is a sideline] means that the activity exerts a mysterious power toward the object. In the old form of Tsujiura, "Kotodama no Sakihafu Michi no Yachimata" is said to be a godly word in the unconsciously abandoned words of the passers-by, and with the suggestion of the spirit of the gods. It is power. In short, it seems to be a word that says the magical power and the foretelling power of the divine language. From that belief, even the spells made by humans were considered to be accompanied by spiritual power as having been approved by God. From the perspective of this evening, the negotiations with Kametsu Hime can be explained.
My story went into the range of congratulatory words that I haven't explained yet, while talking about the swords. At the same time, nothing has more mixed limits than these two. In order to preach one, I don't go to the point where the other is not annotated. As the range of shoujo became narrower and the congratulatory words gradually expanded to new directions, it became possible to distinguish between the two names. It was around the end of the Asuka dynasty, the capital of Fujiwara, that even the new congratulatory words were said to be shoujo. The name of the congratulatory word was made in Nara, and it is limited to the "Nori to Koto" that is sung in the Shinto ritual called "No" and "To". The name of was finally spread over all the spells.
Life of a bard
One congratulatory job
It is a well-established theory that the fact that one wants to get rid of a person's illness [# aside from "Katsutai"] comes from the beggar that means "Kata". By the way, the reason why the same sick person has been called "Monoyoshi" [# aside from "Monoyoshi"] since 300 years is also a reminder. It is also possible that the beggars [# aside from "Monoyoshi"] had a large number of beggars, or simply included a word of beggar. By the time Monoyoshi [# aside from "Monoyoshi"] becomes a modern-style beggar, he will immediately follow the process of a wandering congratulator-a pilgrim-a beggar in the old sense. I think I'm there. Chiaki Hurray "Sensmanzai" seems to be a singer, but there is no substitute for the private one [# "Monoyoshi" sideline], and later it is one of the "Monoyoshi" sideline]. It ended up being the new name of the club.
One of the many non-human villages in Nara, "Monoyoshi" [sideline], clearly has a document that deals with other people [# "otherside"]. ..
In the "Senku-dori" drawn by Shiori, he said that the rocks would not be shaken because of the merit of the congratulatory message of "Monoyoshi", which makes the mansion firm. Turn to "Kage".
[# Indent two characters from here]
I dream of going up from Azuma to Komayo, but things are often the weather
[# End of indentation here]
The song of a certain kyoka "Hyakushu Horikawa" shows the original meaning of Monoyoshi [# "Monoyoshi" is a sideline]. Things [# "things" are sidelines] are similar to things such as "Mononari" [# "things" are sidelines], but they seem to be the righteousness of agricultural products, but they are vaguely expressed and are a conventional idea since the dynasty. Certain: It may be that the fortune was called a thing [# aside from the "thing"] in the idea of ​​"thing".
Depending on the Eke family, the first-class old literature of the character Monokichi [# "Monokichi" is a sideline] is retained. The idea of ​​saying things [# "things" on the sidelines] and good [# "goods" on the sidelines] is certain, but there are doubts about how to learn the endings. It is an unofficial New Year's event of the court, which can be said to be the origin of the "Celebration of the tree of Sai" and "Yogoto". The meaning of things [# "things" is a sideline] is that the content is fairly widely used. You can feel the fortunes of the year.
The congratulatory words made by the family members at the houses of the big and small names are not only similar to those of Chiaki Mansai, but also various things. There are two other things that are noticeable from dawn to spring. One is "Yume Nagashi (the original form of Hatsuyume)", and the other is "The congratulatory message of the tree" Ki "of Sai" written earlier. It seems that these things have been part of the incidental work of Samurahi [# "Samurahi" sideline] person "Bito" for a long time.
Even if a gokenin is a kind of slave, he is a samurai of posterity, even if he is called a child of a family [# a child of a house] according to the times. However, it was not an honorary title so much that he felt the name "Gokenin". The Toneri who went to the monzeki read aloud and said that he was a sideline to "Konin", but he was originally with Samurahito [#sideline to "Samurahito"]. So, it is a private Zuijin that imitates the Toneri. The fact that it comes from the temple is more like a half-priest and a half-professional, but the shape is the same as that of the temple, but the life is more than a resident, and the killing is a thing. It was a monk. Yamaboshi and the Nanto masses were demonstrators of this person. It is one comment that Doho, who was made in the Muromachi palace, abandoned the rough affairs and came out from the direction of the company and temples.
The protagonist who answers to the samurai's chanting, "The one under the tree of Sai, Onkoto," is "If you do, that's a happy sign." .. Immediately, it is a kind of thing that can be called a return congratulatory word. The voice that should be emitted from the inside of the person who received the syllabary is expressed in the form of a voice from the outside as soon as possible. If the so-called "Yogoto", which can be received by Tenshi, has a form in which the voice inside Tenshi answers, it is a good thing to ask. It will be a substitute for the spirits hidden inside you, who will respond to your congratulations. I don't think that Masatsugu Ka is also qualified as a vassal of Yui's mausoleum. It seems that it came from the ritual ability of the priest who naturally possessed it as a prince of the village, such as Mr. Uji [# (ノ)] above.
Many of the return congratulatory words are collected by Mr. Teruoki Hoshino of the Ministry of the Imperial Household.
It can be seen from around the Muromachi period that Chiaki Mansai's celebration of early spring in Miyanaka appears. This was for the singer of Kitahata / Sakuramachi. There are many things that have been moved to Urabe's hands in the office work of Abe. Furthermore, it turned to the Onmyodo, and became the managing director of the slave village under his control. At some point, the slaves of shrines and temples tended to be mistaken for one. I used it again to make it too tatsuki. When the protection of shrines and temples was completely out of reach, he went on to work in roughly the same direction, deciding on the thoughts of the world's eleven swords and swords. Apart from the handicrafts' internal profession, which is based on training, the main business was, in fact, easily confused, and even if they were merged, it was not noticeable. Most of the chanting teachers, etc., were confused and created a profession with complicated contents from the qualification to say that they were temple guys and company guys, but the circle of the word chanting spread unnecessarily, and everything It is also considered from the side that says that it has become possible to accommodate.
The ones that came out of the slaves of the temple are examples of the main story, Toshio, and retribution, which imitated the chanting of Mitsui-ji's preacher, Eiyama's guru. It seems that he talked about the preaching that puts emphasis on, and made it too fluttering. It seems that the song changed completely when he entered Muromachi while being influenced by Dengaku and Sarugaku Noh that came out later. On the other hand, to the shrines who are said to be gods, Urabe's subordinates seemed to be the only source of revenue for the gods, as well as the "Yashikibome", which has been the style of the swordsman since the gods. , Private sector I was asked by Hara, a priest of various times, to make a living. From the end of the dynasty, it gradually merged and appeared as a priestess with a paper crown, who seemed to be a "Konjaku Monogatari". Since it was an era when priests and priests did not hate to go to the Buddha outside of God, the time has come to make it strange even for the strange priests. However, there has been a suggestion from ancient times that must be linked to the main occupation of the chanting gate. It is a predecessor of the oldest form of [# "Other Hito" and a sideline].
It was at the beginning of Edo that the scholars under his control had to abandon the preaching verse due to the prohibition of the Tomimon family. In the meantime, as a new form of preaching, he had a song-like song and "Kusemai", and had been squeezing "Hara" and "Yashiki" in the mansion. However, in the world of the Warring States period, there was a peaceful life that transcended the fantasies of historians above the people below. They have come to live a life that never leaves the land. Side jobs have been recognized by the public to the extent that they can support their livelihoods. This point is a little different, but even from the fact that the actors of Dengaku and Sarugaku toured the territories of the remote areas of the Tadana tribe, it is a reminder that they are seen as one with a completely indigenous peasant. Will not go.
Monoyoshi [# "Monoyoshi" sideline] quickly lost his relationship with the company, and when Chiaki Mansai of the court became a samurai with a singer, the celebration of the beginning of the year given by the child of a local lord's family , It is not limited to a samurai of a certain family. As a congratulatory message, there are some that have become professional and some that have lost their vocational consciousness.
Monoyoshi [# "Monoyoshi" is a sideline] and hurray have come to be seen as two because of the different names of the private sector and the court, but they are actually one. All the local things [# "Monoyoshi" sidelines] have been changed to court-style and urban-style names, and I forgot to put them in the Meiji and Taisho national language dictionaries as "a synonym for leprosy. A dialect". Was done.
Even from the word "word", it seems that Monoyoshi [# "Monoyoshi" is a sideline] is older than the latter, which seems to have repeated "Chiaki Mansai" at the end of the phrase. It cannot be argued that this good [# sideline to "monoyoshi"] is a continuation of [# sideline to "other hito"] before the differentiation of significance, but in general, it is abbreviated. It seems that they are "almost" in contact with each other. To the number of days and months [# To the number of days and months] ・ Farming, congratulations, and the things that various gods have done change their shape in order and become the next figure. Rather than seeing it as a single species, it can be seen that it came out later / \ with various shapes and colors depending on the times and regions. However, since it complicates logic on the contrary, there is no choice but to stop focusing on the idea of ​​direct and collateral systems and look at the facts.
2 Annotation of "Beggar's poem"
Manyo Maki 16 has a lot of things that look like epic poems. Among them, the one that is particularly unusual is the two-headed choka called "Beggar's Song". Even if you don't inevitably learn this as a song with other beggars [# aside from "songs with other beggars"], the concept of beggars at that time and their lives can be seen. He does not run a livelihood on the land, but includes contempt for being a person who can be nourished by people from the point of saying that he is fluent in his travels. By no means does it refer to the proletariat of the early modern period. However, it is certain that he is a bard.
In the middle of the Heian period, the beggars [# "others" are on the sidelines] will not be separated from the beggars, so it is possible to use this as a foothold to proceed with inference. Other hi and [# "other hi and" sideline] are professions of Shinto rituals such as room "Muro" and Tono no other hi [# "other hi" sideline] to sing the norito, and the contents are divided. I went around with something that turned into a ritual. It is an imagination that there is no mistake in saying that he is the oldest traveling entertainer and kadozuke entertainer.
By the way, it is doubtful that the lyric songs that other hi and [# "other hito" are on the sidelines] are creative works. The sword gradually broke, taking in the outside elements, gradually making it epic, and the ingenuity of the true meaning that made people's eyes and ears entertain, suddenly changed in nature. wash. What scholars have never believed in so far is that the puppets must be added to the history of theater. Besides, it is an epic dance. I have a chance to say this later.
Even from the content of this song, there are many parts that seem to be meaningful only if it is accompanied by a gesture [# "gesture" is accompanied by a sideline]. "Deer Song" is designed to perform a light movement of raising and lowering the neck and bouncing around like a deer bowing. The "Crab Song" also has the appearance of lying down and the behavior of spitting bubbles and moving the eyes. I don't know if a person or a doll showed the gesture [# "sideline to the gesture"]. The main thing that pleased the ancient people of dance was the gesture [# "the sideline to the gesture"]. In fact, the traces are fully visible. This was intricately linked to the theater of the Shinto ritual, and he leaned more and more toward the direction of making people laugh by imitating [# "imitation" alongside]. Show that both Sarugaku and Kabuki plays are imitations of human ugliness and strange behaviors of familiar animals [# sidelines to "impersonation"] and gestures [# sidelines to "gesture"]. I'm here.
If imagination is allowed, I would like to comment on this song. Deer are terrifying enemies in the mountains and crabs in rural areas by the water. It is a bitter experience that has passed since our ancestors that deer, of course, are eaten by crabs, clawed, and rice is devastated. It can be imagined from the congratulatory words that were made later that it would be thought that the agricultural word "Yogoto" had a phrase related to wind and water. At the same time, I am not saying any harm to animals. However, there is no doubt that there was an appropriate spell on the circumstances of the land that was introduced to the company, in addition to the congratulatory words transmitted from the court to the companies of the countries. I think there was also a spell that threatened birds and beasts and insects and tried to disperse them.
When the style of other-hi [# "other-hi" is on the sidelines] is differentiated and is about to become an art form, the words of the wind that afflict those animals are strongly expressed, and they are also shown to play the movements. If the expression that it surrenders and says that it is an honor to devote itself to human beings appears in both the lyrics and the gesture [# "beside the" gesture "], the origin of this song I can understand the significance of. I would like to talk about the format side of this song later.
Dance for the first time in three
In order to strengthen the effect of the spell, while chanting the spell, the spirit is rashed or acts like a scare. Even in Dengaku and Sarugaku, there are still some swords that demonstrated something like Totsugi [# "Totsugi" on the sidelines]. This is because the spirits are enthusiastic and the production is enriched. It must have been done to discipline the spirits. This is one of the reasons why the gesture [# "besides the gesture"] has a deep relationship with Shinto ritual. However, as a tendency of Shinto ritual, from the place where the ritual was made into a dance and a play, a gesture dance [# "sideline to" gesture dance "] was created.
Hayato's impersonation [# sideline to "impersonation"] is just an explanation in the explanation of the origin of the epic, but a person who is drowning in water, which seems to be a degree of dance. The gesture [# sideline to "gesture"] and impersonation [# sideline to "imitation"].
It is said that Tatsumahi is the name of the dancer who has been standing up, but since the dynasty, he often went to the private sector, "Hikiudomahi". It seems that the old one of "" was lost because the old word "Tatsu" [# "Tatsu" is a sideline] was used as the name. It was King Hirokage [# (No)] who danced this dance, and it was also at the time of Murohogi [# "Murohogi" sideline] of the shrunk idea "Shimi" that he often said. If you can look back at the idea of ​​the Heian dynasty, which was thinking of the spirit of the god as a dwarf, the explanation would be good.
Tonago Mai is a tribute to a long tradition at Ise Jingu. Ordinary chick / \ Mai [# "Hiyo / \ Mai" is a sideline] and also says that it is a dance that imitates the appearance of chicken chicks, so after all that lame-like body [# "body" It is a gesture of "Tsuki" and a sideline.
Deer and crab noko [# "koko" sideline] The gesture of a person or a doll that imitates the movement is about the chanting of the sword system and [# "other hieto" sideline]. It cannot be said that he was absent.
Relics of 4 and others [# sidelines to "others"]
What was left behind in the posterity of [# "Other Hito"] was a tool that bears that name in addition to the venerable name and the kadozuke art. It is said that the words such as "Hoka" and "Hokaizuku", which look like Engi-shiki, are one thing with the liner. It was thought that its legs turned outward and came out of four places with a clawfoot wind. It's quite big, and you can think of it as a swanky wind. ｜ Slightly small, with a border, and a desk-like item that seems to be a serving, is said to be an "outdoor plan". Although there is a difference in phonology between "hi" and "ゐ", the note value of these two sounds has not yet been determined in this era, and it was a time when conversion was free. It does not mean the difference between things.
However, the private sector other hi [# "other hi" sideline] in the late era is not so big. It seems that the shape has changed a lot. This vessel, which often appears in picture scrolls, is small in shape and can be carried by one person for travel and outings.
I think that this device, which was used regularly by other people and [# "other people" by the sideline], was convenient and was used in general by resembling its shape regardless of its size. If you can infer one step further, it is an old man's trip to go out with as much as possible by putting it on the head, neck, shoulders, hanging it, or carrying it. Anyway, I became accustomed to traveling life and became accustomed to traveling life as a domestically produced tool for carrying luggage for two or three people. ] It seems that it was from the hands of the people. By the way, it is reasonable that the abbreviation of "Other Hi" and [# "Other Hi" and "Side Line"] is the name of the vessel as a memorial to the inventor. It is a logical path.
The fact that the liner is pronounced in Kiyone as "Other Hi" [# "Other Hi" is a sideline] can be considered from the address of the outside house. Chikashi Koizumi also taught that in Awa-gun, Awa-gun, his hometown, the offerings of the Yama-no-Kami Festival are preserved just for use when climbing from the houses. Thank you.
If the outside house used for the court has the same origin as the palace, it is unknown when and how it entered. It seems certain that it is a vessel related to Shinto ritual.
It is conceivable that even as a bard, he continued to cast his main business spells even when he stepped into the direction of performing arts. No matter how their profession was differentiated, a kind of divine belief was accepted. It is hard to imagine that he could not walk with a box containing the container and body of the god spirit during the journey around while performing the gate art, reciting the Norito. It is often the case that a drifting missionary carried a boxed spirit. Other Hi [# "Other Hi" sideline] was originally addressed to that purpose, but it can be said that it has expanded the range of use. Professor Kunio Yanagita was made public in a treatise (history) that once said "the god of moray eels and water." Originally, the box is not just a container, but a god spirit, and if you follow the line, you can see the religious meaning of the moray eel [# "moray eel" sideline] and moray eel [# "moray eel" sideline]. I'm preaching. If you look at that, I hope that my discussion will be quickly convinced.
The source of the tool called "Other Hi" [# "Other Hi" is a sideline] shows that the bard was a wandering missionary at the same time, and a group of Shinto ritual entertainers who continue their long journey is in the capital of Fujiwara. It must be said that it is a delicate cause to think that it already existed.
The fall of Go Other Hi [# "Other Hi" sideline]
The beggar's poem was created in an era when the people were not yet conscious of creativity, no matter how new. The first appearance of creative poetry was in the latter half of Kakinomoto no Hitomaro's era, if represented by humans. The metamorphosis of the spell epic, which looks like a lyric of a crab or a deer, was made at the same time as the first half, or when it seems a little old.
The form is freshly written, and the content is based on the lyrical part of the epic. This shows that the Norito and the storyteller are about to merge. By the way, how did the other people [# "other lines"] and others start their life away from home?
The storyteller was hot as a part of the epic tradition, but it is doubtful whether a professional association that claims Norito was recognized. Not only can we not see the independent traces of Naruhi [# "Kakibe" on the sideline], but also the other hi [# "Kakibe" on the sideline]. Of course, it is a congratulatory word, but there are many examples of oral traditions by senior gods, and it comes from the meaning of saying that the priests of the priests-Kokuzo = village prince. As it may be, there is an example in which the chief priest, who was the master of the superior tribe, plays. By the way, it seems that this is not a Shinto ritual with a sense of specialization as a profession and a sense of family profession. On the other hand, in the Heian dynasty, the gods of the lower classes have already appeared, such as the priest (Nori Toshi). Besides, chanting spells is not the village's specialty, but Ning, except for the important events of the traditional village, it has nothing to do with Kotobuki. When it comes to this, the qualifications of the gods for this matter will gradually go down. Moreover, in the regions where the memory of the times when the village prince and others did not think about the word was still stopped at that time, young people who had passed the coming-of-age ceremony dressed as gods as "temporary" Ittoki "priests". I also chanted a spell. It remains not only in Okinawa, but even in today's mainland of the Taisho era. In the wind, there are young people, priests and priests, and people who recite various spells, and there are also people who suddenly become religiously aware, so those who handle spells are indispensable. It must be diverse.
It is conceivable that the shoujo, which celebrates the houses of the villages and their production, tends to follow the affairs of young people or lower-ranking gods. As the religions of the villages are gradually translated into the shrine system, those who have little relation to the shrine begin to fall. Others [# "Others" are on the sidelines] were originally before the shrine system, and negotiations with the shrines have continued since then. The priests who belong to it also have a tendency to be seen lightly in order to not be in the correct priesthood. At the court, the priests of the Nakatomi and the priests of the priests play spells, but the priests go to the side of the shrine system, and the priests of the priests are the old customs, Hori and others [# Therefore, the former had to be defeated.
It's not a reminder that there is nothing wrong with the other companies [# "other lines"]. Outside of such things as Harae, fortune-telling, and Majinahi [# "Majinahi" sideline], the "Prayer Year" Toshigohi "spell is closely related to the meaning of Yogoto [#" Yogoto "sideline]. Even "(grain word)" and "longevity spell (age word)" have deviated from the range of other hi [# "other line"].
When the presence or absence of a shrine becomes the only condition for qualification of a god, the spirits subject to other hi [# "other hi" are sidelines] are clearly ranked lower. When it came to me, the value of the Norito became low, and a high-meaning Norito and a new spell for the god of gods came out under the name of Nori and [# "Norito" alongside]. It was decided to replace it.
The congratulatory message that had already fallen into a position was further differentiated into a kind of profession. As a temporary priest, "Itsutokikannushi", the asylum or the fallen people of the young people in the village who are proficient in other gods [# "other lines"] and the gods of the villages who are separated from the rear shields It seems that this is an old figure that has become a profession, with a congratulatory message along with fortune-telling, exile, and majinahi [# "majinahi" alongside the line].
The glaring feeling between the villages makes this traveler feel at ease even in a world that is still in its infancy. The foreign god was both feared and respected. In many cases, the new god of Imaki, who was indulged in the spiritual power and the dull native god, approached the two gods of good fortune and evil. The gods who bring new guest gods from foreign countries also showed the power of curse. At the same time as chanting yogoto [# "yogoto" with a white circle emphasis mark] (yo) and grain [# "grain" with a white circle emphasis mark] (yo), a plague・ I was able to use rice bugs. The pattern of the belief of the everlasting "Tokoyo" god (Tokoyo) in Suruga and Yawata, who moved eastward from Kyushu, shows how the power of the new god moved people's hearts. I couldn't convince myself that I was able to make a living through the foreign countries of [# "Other Hito"] without taking this into consideration.
While touring the villages, they sprinkled folklore and walked. Considering that he was carrying the power as mentioned on the right, it can be inferred that the result was unexpectedly great.
Besides, it seems that the gods are also involved in this first step movement. At the same time, it is impossible to explain why the parade was able to travel freely. So, I'd like to take care of this now | my mother-in-law and think about it.
Spreading six epics
The fact that Other Hi [# "Other Hi" is a sideline] was not independent like the storyteller as a part song is considered to be the reason why it came to include miscellaneous areas for the sake of being a bard. You can do things.
As you can see from the beggar's poem, the dramatic structure and lyrical ideas added to the style of the beggar "Yogoto" are due to the influence of the storyteller's story. It is. I am thinking about the storytellers of the villages among the gods who have lost their guardians. Besides, if the other hi [# "other hi" sideline] (congratulations) is not a professional event as a god, the storyteller is another hi [# "other hi" side line], other hi [ There may be some people who said that they were telling the "story" to a certain extent by making # "other line"]. Originally, it is a person who is not an amateur of Maru / \ against God. Incorporating the epic of the storyteller into the chanting to create a strange shape is not without its swelling.
Not only was it taken in, but the storyteller also said that it was an epic poem that was far from [# "other hi"] in the main meaning of the story [# "other hi". If you're in the middle of an epic, that's what it should be. In fact, the traces will be mentioned gradually, but they will certainly remain.
Instead, the complete story and the story breaks are carried away from one village to another. Then, what happens there is the exchange of stories and the dissemination. What is not overlooked is the emergence of new stimuli in the hearts of those who have never evoked literary impulses. There are many varieties of one legend that can be found on the Kiki, Ki, Manyo, and Fudoki, and on several narratives. It is no longer conceivable that the myths and legends that simply solved this problem and translated the same folklore should show similarities. At the very least, it is a lie that even from the circumstances of the bards already before the Nara dynasty, we do not consider a stronger driving force here.
Epic sprinkling
Ichikarebito
Before talking about the life of the storyteller "Kataribe", I have to describe the state of the era when the negotiations with the story of the storyteller were deepened at the end of the Norito "Yogoto". I had to do it. Regarding this, I think that you have made one spare based on what can be said to be an outline that I have already written, so I hope that you will be exempted from the latter, and other hi [# "other hi" sideline] We will continue to follow the epic path. The outbreak of Japanese prostitutes and the path leading to their fixation are often the opinions of Professor Kunio Yanagita, which can be disdained by the ideas of his predecessors. Yes, it is also an iron plan. The teacher is a woman and a puppeteer who was an ancient wanderer who lived almost the same life as [# "Jipushii" sideline]. The existence of a traveling woman (Kareme) was proved (serialized in an anthropological magazine around 1891). The group, which has set the tone of life as a belief of a different god due to the fallout of the indigenous people, visits various places during the week, and along with the development of stations and tsu, the land of the throat of the land and sea. I decided to settle in. It is said that women's performing arts (kabuki and even drama) and selling colors have become the main business, and they have become the head of the inn or the chief of the inn. I think that there are asylum-seekers who have jumped out and became unregistered outside the kerebito [# "Karebito" sideline] after this unassimilated people. In other words, the fact that it is [# "other hito" is a sideline] is the accumulation mentioned earlier.
The reason why the gods lose the protection of the great tribe of Danapati is complicated. The fact that the villager who protected the god died, and that the content of the village's faith was easy. Here, too, the breakdown is considered in about three ways. A kind that incorporates the god of Honji Suijaku or translates it into a trace-like style (1). Even if it is from a weak village or a dead village, it is a kind that was awe-inspired as a new god "Imakigami" (2). Buddhism (3), which has a lot of Taoist colors, can be mentioned in the same category. In the regions where it was not possible to adapt to this change of faith, the "death of the gods" began gradually. Someone who escapes from the Bon-gwan by using the power of saying that there is one new god to other towns while protecting the mukuro of the gods [# sideline to "mukuro"]. , Later came out as / \. Therefore, the style of worship was old, and it also became an unintentional fixation. This is one of the reasons why the god enshrined by Karejin [# "Karejin" is on the sidelines] appears strange to the eyes of people after the middle of the Heian period. I have missed the opportunity to speak about dolls, but among the villages that have a deep relationship with Wamoto Village, the ones that have had a doll called "Katashiro", the god's form, have been around for a long time. There are steps. It cannot be determined that he was not in the village of Wa. In an era when the extraordinary god's form gradually loses its meaning and the number of people's form increases, it is no wonder that the belief of a group that treats humans exclusively as a resident is heretical. ..
The gods and gods of Omura, who had been esteemed from Yamotomura, seemed to have made a happy transition, albeit gradually becoming deceased. However, in a village that enshrines a god who has not been able to think about it by linking the pedigree with the village, even if the village is still a county territory and should lose its power, the god and the gods are not treated. I saw my eyes. It is in these villages that the effectiveness of the Taika politics, which tears the politics, has come to the fore. For some reason, when a person who has nothing to do with Kuni-no-Miyatsu becomes a county territory, or when a Kokushi who comes from the center does something without considering the local circumstances. Being in Bon-gwan was a source of active suffering. The god of the Hinata Tono "Tsunu" shrine was made a slave of the Kokushi by me as a national guard. The wrath of the gods led to the extinction of the seeds of the gods instead of giving the Kokushi a wrath (Hyuga Fudoki Ibun). This is sad evidence that the Kuni-no-Miyatsu god had power in the county territory but powerless in the officials appointed by Wakoku. At the same time, he is showing that he has fallen into a life without a sword, which is probably a double slave of a lower god. Some of the gods of the villages have been accused of being the new gods of the gods, and some have been treated like the gods of the gods from the lower ranks of the gods. The pain of not leaving Bon-gwan has not been so much yet.
Among the village songs, the ones who can support themselves even if they lose their guardians are mainly the houses that have been attacked by handicrafts. The misery of others is enough to guess. The first thing that is dismissed from the times and protection is the divine class.
Thinking of asylum as being on top of a couple of people or a family was too accustomed to the circumstances of the early modern period. Before the Warring States period, there were countless houses that abandoned Bon-gwan and moved to a place hundreds of ri away with many family groups under the name of developing new wisdom. .. Instead of belief, it is nothing more than a karebito [# aside from "karebito"] who walked with force. This new Karebito [# "Karebito" sideline] also helped the powerful tribes along the way as a mercenary army. Fortunately, it became a daimyo, and those who did not grow much became a gokenin with a personality under the family, and ended up squeezing with a non-gokenin / gokenin. In the history of the family register in Japan, it is the matter of group asylum that must be reconsidered. From the journey to seek a comfortable place to live, the convenience of living opens up to the end of the journey, and the tour is completed as one lifestyle. Even if their beliefs lose their power, they drifted as migrants until the performing arts did not deviate from the interests of the times and until their profession was completely differentiated. is there.

Early modern art plays an important role in music, drama, and dance, as it can be said that it developed under the umbrella "Karakasa". The thing that is about to be held over the saleswoman is not something that imitates the customs of a nobleman or China. The Kare woman [# "Kare woman" sideline] who showed her performing arts to a group of former Kazusa bosses at Mt. Ashigara settled down under a large umbrella (reclassification diary). "Tamai", which looked like a large mirror, seems to be centered around an umbrella standing in the rice field. These two are old places at the end of the Heian dynasty. After that, it can be said that Dengaku was a remarkable thing, and those who did not have an umbrella in folk performing arts were lonely. Below the umbrella is the place where the main person entrusted to the Shinto ritual is. It was a style that had been in the court of the palace before the arrival of the continental style, and it expressed and protected the sacred feeling. The shape of the sara, which seems to be a musical instrument of the Karejo [# "Karejo"] system, may have changed considerably in posterity, but in fact it is said to have been warm since the days of the Manyo people. There is a guess. These things may not be strong evidence, but the fact that they seem to be strange may actually indicate that they are not different from those of a permanent resident.

The only point is that dolls are not the focus of modern Shinto scholars, but they also seem to have an unthinkable habit of pure production in ancient Japan, so I feel that I must mention the beginning of the story.
Two kutsu [# sideline to "kutsu"] previous drama
There is a document in the middle of the Heian dynasty that a woman from the wandering people Narukutsu [# "Kutsu" is on the sidelines] danced a doll. It was really suddenly from the time of the Muromachi period that it seemed to be flourishing. Historians have struck a chord with the dark ages of war and warriors, but writing alone is, in fact, an era full of rich power that suggests the civilization of the commoners of Edo. It was a respected world of things that were at the bottom of the underground "Dige", sick of the upper and middle layers of civilization [# "Domi" on the sidelines]. Even before this, it can be inferred that the drama was performed by low-ranking gods and Kutsu [# "Kutsu" by the sidelines] in some places. Because it was a new style, the group of even drama that was delighted by the metropolitan people will be centered around Nishinomiya in Settsu Hirota. But perhaps this cannot be seen as the originator of the puppet show. In the biography on this side, the Awaji doll is taken seriously. At the same time, Nishinomiya should be seen from the point that it is closely related to the sea, and it is also possible that the islanders of Awaji on the opposite bank, who were under the power of this god, gave excellent skill. In Muromachi, the power of those who use male puppets gradually emerges, but the alien drama of the Nishinomiya system is originally trained in the hands of women, especially prostitutes. The prostitute, who had begun to settle down on the Yodo River and its tributary, had a close relationship with Nishinomiya. It seems that the Nishinomiya religion spread to Kansai based on the chanting of Karejin [# "Karejin" alongside]. Karejin [# "Karejin" sideline] takes the form of an old-fashioned visit to God [# "Otherhi" sideline]. The puppet dancer called Ebisu oyster [# aside from "Ebisu oyster"] left this old simple form for posterity.
Even in the first year of the Taisho era, beggars who danced at each gate to sing "Ebisu-sama [#" Ebisu-sama "side line] came to thank you from Nishinomiya" are also in this flow. It is known that "Daikoku Mai" was also one of the gesture plays of a person dressed as a god against the spouse of Ebisu Kaki [# "Ebisu Kaki" alongside]. "Daikoku Mai", which came out late, has already expanded the territory other than Other Hi [# "Other Hi" alongside] before Genroku, and the lyrics tend to be a little complicated story in spite of the simpleness of Mai Hiburi. What was there was that the other hi [# "other hi" sideline] was broken in the same direction many times, and the calm place showed that it was a lyric song with a dramatic concept.
Looking at Nishinomiya Ichisha, it was the god's gesture that was made to play the god's gesture by the doll as the god's form "Katashiro" coming from you in the sea at each festival. Because it was used for the congratulatory message of "Nishinomiya", it seems that he has taken the first step toward performing arts as a gate art.
Although dolls are the center of the festival at the Hachiman shrine, there are other shrines like Rikyu Hachiman, which are like Matsuo's shrines that use dolls at the old shrines in Yamashiro. It seems that it may be called "Muzane". At local companies, there are currently / \ who are mainly idols. This doll is called "Seinau".
On the side of Usa Hachiman, the "blue farming" thing is especially noticeable. Chikuzen, which is closely related to Yawata | Shiga "Deer" [# (No)] At the island festival, row out offshore to make the doll possess the spirit of the god, and see the sea from the top of the ship * [# "Clan" Instead of the "number" of "rank", the third level 1-91-13] "Nozo" is used.
In the Heian dynasty literature, in the court, you can see this doll and what is thought to be one name, "Wo", a man of "sai". It is the one who appears at the time of the Kagura "Mikagura". Until now, the fact that the talented man [# aside from the talented man] is considered to be a person who plays humorous in the Kagura seat is the development of the spell. I mentioned in the place. After "Mai of the chief" Ninjiyau "", I will write that there is a "state of a talented man" in Sakeichi | Later, he came to think of a talented man [# aside from the "talented man"] as a person, but he was originally showing that he was a human being. The character "voice" indicates that the character [# "emphasis mark"] and the gesture [# "emphasis mark"] were performed with a gesture [# "emphasis mark"]. It seems that he tries to clearly convince God's will by repeating the movements of his spouse during the kagura in a simple translation style. Also, in an era when dolls weren't used [# "Saino" on the sidelines], they may have only imitated dolls in an old-fashioned way. For now, I think it's better to go to the previous thought. The clown who imitates every move of the other party and makes him / \ is called "Modoki" (# "Modoki" is a sideline] (牾), and is regarded as a humorous part of the Shinto ritual. Isn't it possible to say "the state of a talented man" to show the starting point of the role of "Modoki" [# "sideline to" Modoki "]? It can be explained from various sides that the Kagura of Miyanaka is influenced by the Yawata system. Therefore, the idea of ​​seeing a talented man [# aside from "talented man"] as a spouse, like "blue farming", stands out.
In the olden days, when a plague was epidemic, a huge image of a god was built and set on the road to worship it (Shoku Nihongi). Even now, he carries a grass doll around and throws it away. All the rice worms follow me and I think about it. This is an idol of the spirits of filth, sin, and evil. The idea is to carry all the harmful substances in the future and return to the country of the book.
The meaning of "things" has changed a little by stroking "Hara", which is a human form. The influence of Taoism is invading the idea of ​​substituting another thing.
Anyway, the ones that people in the old days were always accustomed to were their own idols, or the beast-shaped ones that changed from lions and dogs, always settled close to them, and sucked and stored the filth. It was an idol. However, the origin of the doll cannot be categorized simply as the filthy form of the doll, Amagatsu, and Hoko. It can be said that the cause of the wind playing with the doll "Ningiau" is that the idol on the right side of this seat has a clue. While being a doll "Hitogata" that looks like a filth, a sword, or a lump of sin, if you get used to it, you will become a toy. Gosekku is a folklore of China in order to avoid the offense of committing people by taking advantage of the changing seasons. By adding a circle of thought to the Harae, which is more peculiar to this, we made the ritual offering strict. The puppets of March and May enshrined the god's form of shedding and sending gods, but this has been replaced by the idea of ​​puppets. There is still a place to worship dolls in Tanabata and Chungyang. In addition to the spirit vehicles, you can imagine the idols possessed by the spirits on the spirit shelf of the Bunranbon. Bon also probably learns the appearance of "To the Harae of Natsukoshi".
The author of the reclassification diary prayed with a young heart, all gods [# "everyone god" sideline], court palace * [# "mouth + sheep", 3rd level 1-15-1] festival "Miyanomematsu" A doll hung on a bamboo leaf, a princess of Hassaku who still goes to Kitakyushu (Himegojiyo), these are not items that have been transferred. In principle, the true doll of God is a temporary thing. It is different from the Buddhist statue that is permanently enshrined. It is the gods or people whose boundaries between the gods and Buddha are not clear that the wooden statues of the gods remain today. Only at festivals, dolls with divine qualifications are often made new, but they usually do not show the sun, and there are few things that can be preserved for a long time.
And it seems that the doll as the true identity of the god is not limited to the god who bothers human beings. If this point is not clear, the doll is considered to have come from the idea of ​​"Sokue".
There are still regions that are afraid of dolls. The emotions that come from both awe and awe still remain in the remote areas. It is a fact that entertainers who dance puppets, such as Bunrakuza, feel that the puppets have a creature-like feel. On the main island of Okinawa, there are people who are said to be Nembutiyaa, who are seen below the commoners. In spring, I say a small box hanging on my chest-Tera [# "Tera" is a sideline]. The word "word" is a collection of shrines, temples, and Tsujido. In seeing the stage of the puppet as a place of sacred ritual, while dancing the puppet, he sang a story about the Japanese "Yamato" who said Kyotaro "Chandara" and went around the island. It is a thing. Since the doll hasn't been used for a long time, the limbs have become incomprehensible, but I was very scared to handle it. It is said that this doll often had strange things.
The cause of the vague mood that the dolls are said to have never been in ancient times is that the first production and acting was attached to Prince Shotoku, Hata [# (ノ)] Kawakatsu "Kahakatsu". Because I am here. The masks have a particularly deep feeling of being after the introduction of foreign countries, but considering the path that the Japanese people have moved, it is inevitable that they are in the form of dance and before the masks of the Buddha and Bodhisattva, which are memorial services. It's hard to say that it's something that hasn't happened. However, this technician mask "Omotetsuku" belongs to the temples, and the temporary productions of the gods are influenced by their craftsmanship and can be preserved on the wooden surface. Since I asked for sculpture, the unique style of the mask became unknown, and it is more appropriate to see it as something that was forgotten even when it was used in the Shinto ritual of the mask.
Since the mask does not make you think that it is a god who is dressed as a human being, it is also a very secret, and after using it, I thought that it would be visible to people and took appropriate measures. Since it is a matter of fact, it seems that the idea of ​​a mask is not clear to ordinary people. In addition, depending on the land, it was said that a villager had to be dressed as a villager, so there was something like a broad-leaved plant with a broad-leaved face. Looks like in modern times. Therefore, there is a mask, and there is no doubt that the masque was performed, but for now, I can't leave my imagination.

In the illustration of Tanehiko Ryutei's reading book "Asama Individual Soshi", the bad guys in the village wrote various aspects of the company on New Year's Eve to the house of a virgin without parents. So, the place to take out household goods is drawn. The form that the person who wrote the mask visits on New Year's Eve is no different from the one obtained from the folklore.

On the face, the words Kazu [# "Kazu" on the sideline] or Kaburu [# "Kaburu" on the sideline] are used as examples of terms because the ancient face covers the face from overhead. It shows that he was there.
Even if you look at it in Nogaku, it is the woman who wears the face outside the god and spirit. A woman is usually a mad woman who is considered to be a godly possession. It may be possible to think that the Noh actor treated the same as God's better [# "between" than ""], in addition to the reason why the woman cannot be served in the face "Hitaomote". Leaving the legend of the prince and Nogaku, if you look at it quietly, you can imagine the dance of ta-asobi [# "ta-asobi" on the sidelines], which is a prototype of an old man, with his head wrapped in a simple mask. It is. The Bodhisattva of Toma-ji Temple | The masked appearance of the gods who descend to the traditional god festival, such as the training road "Rendau", may be the backing.
Among the sentences left in the Kojiki, if you look at the ones that retain the epic form, you can see that not only the lyrical part of the song [# "Uta" is a sideline] but also the epic part [# " Some of them belong to "Storytelling". The storytelling is the text of the earth. The occurrence of the text of the earth should not be the first step. The essential form is first-person, and the content is third-person. However, what clearly reveals the meaning of the text of the earth is the demand for dramatic announcements in the groundwork. This is a stylistic theory, and I have the opportunity to write it in detail.
Thus, you can believe that there was an even drama. At the same time, to what extent did the physical expression appear? How big was it used for the festivals in the villages? Everything is questionable. Did you reveal the god from a distant country and the spirit of the feature with a human being? I don't know that either. Judging from the materials of posterity, the talented man [# alongside the "talented man"] looks like a spirit of a feature. At the same time, I wrote about this in the development of the spell. Moreover, it seems that there was no mixed acting of people and puppets.
There are also simple dances in the Shinto ritual drama of the spouse. The history of God that appeared in the epic is repeated every year. In short, in Shinto ritual theater, regardless of people or puppets, the performers are all exposed to the body, and the lyrical and lyrical parts are crushed, but people are attached from the side.
The dolls of the festivals of posterity are not the only ones that do not move. Judging from the appearance of the performer, the doll itself looks like a light and funny behaviour.

The kind of festival dashi dolls [# sidelines to "dashi dolls"] is by no means an idea of ​​the early modern period. All festival stalls are Hoko [# "Hoko" sideline], Yama [# "Yama" sideline], Dashi [# "Dashi" sideline], Danjiri [# "Danjiri" sideline], etc. It comes from the original idea of ​​"Yama", the mountain of "Heu". In the early Heian dynasty, Horaiyama was already built on the "Mountain of Mark" and the shape of a hermit was set up. The "mountain of the mark" is the place where the gods descend, and it is thought that they should be towed to receive the gods at the festival grounds. This mountain is connected to the god's sign, which is a sign of the god [# "Tabuu" alongside the line], and at the same time, it is thought that the god's form "Katashiro" is set up. The "Mountain of Marks" is probably a mountain made of leaves and is one of the ancient rituals to receive the gods (Izumo Fudoki). The significance of the making mountain was solid, and the reason for the existence of the doll set up above was forgotten early.
[# End of indentation here]
If the Sen doll, which is thought to have been Taoist, is seen as a doll, it is probably already hot at the height of the Nara dynasty, and it is probably not a toy but a worship of a Fangshi. The contents of the hermits who went to Fujiwara, Nara, and the early Heian period were lustrous, and there were also hermits who were waiting for an encounter with a human man. It wasn't just the hermits who seemed to sacrifice the rags of posterity. Forgetting the true meaning of the "mountain of the mark", the decoration includes the intention of making Senzan and celebrating the life of Tenshi. The fact that a doll is placed here, which is not thought to be a design that began in the Heian dynasty, is thought to be a divine form in an era when the original meaning was clear.
Three new other hi [# "other hi" sideline] lyrics

On the stone [# (ノ)] | The adult "Mikoto" of Nunodome "Full" is attached to the rope of the horse and the bow and arrow of the animal "Shi" by the dazzling "Madohi" of the maiden "Tawayame". Look at Kaku, see the prince's command, Mikoto Kashiko, and sneak into the heavenly rope, Hinabe. Maybe it won't come back to the mountains of the true earth even when it's old (Sir Ishigami Otomaro Tosa Kuniyuki Tokika Sanshu average tanka, Manyo Maki 6)
[# End of indentation here]
It's just a song when it was distributed to Tosa, and it's not a song of anyone. From the example of ordinary writing, this should be called "Tokijin no Uta". If not, like Kogi, the front two heads are "Songs of Otomaro's wife (also see the other party Kume [# (No)] Wakame)", and the rear two heads are " There should be a note in the style of saying "Otomaro's song". It is correct to treat it in the same way as Mazu Vol. Then, I can understand the strangeness of the wording. Since Furu and Ishigami are extremely close to each other, and both Mr. Ishigami and Mr. Furu are also members of the Mononobe clan, they are also members of the same family. Since it exists as Tsuki [# "Retsuki" is an emphasis mark], there is no way to adopt such an expression. After all, using the Makurakotoba, he struck Mr. Ishigami, and because he was close to his contemplation, he immediately received the suggestion and issued a companion sword, and it was possible that he smelled the hero of the famous case by chance. , A wise way to do it. This is the first proof that it wasn't made by someone close to you. "Madohi, the maiden" is also an interest that needs not be said unless it is a storytelling thing that inherits the shape of the story. Next, the arrangement of place names is strange. Looking at this song, it shows that we are going over Mt. However, in the third song, it seems to go beyond the word "Kashiko" of the Kawachi border. By the way, since it is the route to visit the god of Sumiyoshi, it seems that the company of Sumiyoshi that appears in the second song does not indicate that he will worship only Haruka. Then, a contradiction is considered. In the fourth tanka, the name of the place called Osaki, which is found in every country, is mentioned. The only thing that preaches that this is Kii is the attitude of pushing a yoko guruma. It reveals that the quirky point is not a gift of the parties to this song.
It is not a regular route to go to Kii to go to Tosa. It cannot be said that there is no chance of going straight from Kinokawaguchi to Awa and heading to Hamaden Hiisoden Hini Tosa, but the route at that time was still to Namba or Sumiyoshi. .. In any case, it is a fact that there is a mistake in the route.
As a pilgrim is laying down the epic poems of the past [# "others"], the changes in nature that gradually emerged are still memorable to people's rumors. At the time when it was told, and when it was about to enter the territory of history, the turmoil of memory began to make some of the old, forgotten epics of history feel like singing the tragic love of the early modern period, unconsciously. The amendment will add validity to that fact. It is conceivable that the words and phrases were other people's names before the negotiations with this case were made. Nothing is more volatile than the epic / legendary protagonist's name.

In the Nihongi period, the song "Kunishinubi" of the death of Yamato Takeru in the Kojiki was written by Emperor Keiko during his pilgrimage to Tsukushi. Is the same. This is just one example.
[# End of indentation here]
It is often seen in folklore, especially in linguistic tradition, that the validity is freely expanded with time and place. This is also a variant of Kinashi no Karu's epic poem. Since the story of Prince Kinashi no Karu is a kind of exile of a noble species, the previous form is still hot. In the form that tells the story of drifting until the god's seat is reached, the color of love is abundantly added, the cause is thought out, the ending as a human being is attached, and the true appearance of history is taken. Tsuta. Therefore, epic poetry complicates history infinitely. Going further, the fact that it is considered to be a historical fact recorded in the national history after the Shoku Nihongi, with only the diary of the historian and some basic historical materials, the legendary record and the history of China It cannot be said that the Chinese documents of folk tales at that time were not used.
[# Indent from here]
To give the biggest example, there are many sexually explicit negotiations between Shinsen and human beings in the first or third person, which are the records of folk tales in the history of the Tang Dynasty. It spreads to the court, which can be called the Sengu of the human world, and not only can you write with a brush that is brilliant between the emperor and the goddess, but also above the emperor and the people of the back palace. Influencing it, it depict the lustless hometown in detail and seductively.
[# End of indentation here]
Originally it was not a product of fantasy, but a record of folk tales, so it could be called a novel. "Small" is a word that refers to the common people, Ichii, etc., and is a contrast to the government as "large." The theory means narrative and legend.
Therefore, the novel and history are one thing, and it can be said that there is a predictable historical tradition that there is an error that is transmitted to the private sector. I made a mistake because I valued the things compiled by the historian too much, but gradually I became aware of the fact that I was imagining other than the description of historical facts. There, the name "Denki" has the so-called "Romansu" [# "Romansu" sideline] of the country under Rauma rule of Yorotsupa [# "Yorotsupa" sideline]. The novel "Romansu" [# "Romansu" is a sideline] that describes the legends of people, and the story from its establishment to its contents have come to have similarities.
Only Yusen Cave has already arrived in the Nara dynasty, and although it looks like Manyo (Volume 5) in a sentence that imitates it, it cannot be said that there was nothing else. When the Goryeo and Japanese people entered the palace, they must go to the gate of Zhang Wensei and accept the writing and return (Tang dynasty). It cannot be said that he did not look after the history of Goryeo, which recorded the legend of the secret story of Shinsen and the secret of the court. Ning, I think that the books in that direction back up the fact that many were imported. On top of that, the naturalized folklore will be passed down in the future. However, there is nothing in the world that does not have a unity to the point that it is on folklore. Amazing similarities were gradually discovered between Japan and China at that time. The fact that it matches the traditions of developed countries in the hearts of the people of the Fujiwara Palace era, the end of Asuka, makes me feel radiant.
