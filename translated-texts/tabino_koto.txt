With this [# "this is an emphasis mark"], I haven't had a white socks yet.
Mr. Kubota suddenly said that when he came and went, he had a crisp word, but with some kind of excuse and timid tone. The first time I looked at Mr. Kubota's feet, I was rushed to see his feet wearing snow-white socks. I was about to ask, "Oh, what's wrong with that?" This is a great detour. Despite this, Mr. Mantaro is a person who respects his wisdom (?) And often makes an honest excuse similar to that, which makes him vacant.
"I'm going to buy a navy blue socks on the way and replace it. Why can I go to this play!"
"I see." I pointed out. "I don't want to be distracted by the criticism of my socks."
"I'm sorry for the actors," said Mantaro with a laugh. On this day, I went to the play council. (We walked from Tsukubadai to Hongo.)
Mr. Mantaro said he was good at walking. I see, my chest is sticking out, and my pace is rough and fast. It's certainly a stride. I had to make a light effort to keep pace with it. I shouldn't be a slow-moving person either. I'm as thin as "a person who doesn't drink somatose," and Mantaro is the opposite.
"There is a very old-fashioned tabi shop in Hongo. I want to buy it there."
"I see." I muttered again.
"My wife's guy, I made a mess of my white socks and said that it was a tycoon."
"Ha ha ha," I laughed in favor. "I could hear the voice of Satsuki, but I couldn't understand what it was."
"--Only for clothes!"
"Your kimono is in good shape / \."
"You've never worn white socks."
"Even at the wedding, I can remember the white socks."
"It's an exaggeration!"
"... I have never considered the distinction between white socks and black socks."
"It's barbaric!"
Hongo's somehow tabi tabi shop was really old-fashioned. Mr. Mantaro was so complimented that he had a crush on him.
Therefore, Mr. Mantaro, who replaced the white socks with navy socks, left the store saying, "Thank you for your help." Again, I wasn't aware of what Mr. Mantaro came up with, but when he came back and forth, he called me "You, you--" and said, "You guys went shopping and went home. Thank you very much! I don't know the word. I don't need to say that when shopping. 」I was proud to say that I decided to go to the store. When he left, he recalled Mr. Mantaro, who seemed to say such a thing.
"I don't think it's strange. When I was a boy, I was in the countryside, unlike you, but my grandmother's discipline [#" discipline "is the same formula." It's a position, but--. If you get a little drunk or shop, you'll be disappointed! It may be said that he will leave. I made an excuse with a straight face. After Mantaro lightly spotted,
I asked, "What about Kichiji Nakatogawa?"
"Well, how are you!" I smiled. Then, in a whisper, he answered, "Unexpectedly, that's not the case." ――Mr. Mantaro stretched his arms and shook his two fists lightly, and walked in small steps.
At Hongo Sanchome, I broke up with Mr. Mantaro. Soon it began to rain from the cloudy sky that was used by Mantaro's novel. ――When I'm at home, I don't know if Mr. Mantaro hates it or because he can't stand the loneliness, but even if the outside is still bright, he should have left the room at night. It's time for Twilight to be away. ――It was more than a month ago.
