Today, I was asked to say a word about the patriotism song, but since the Greater East Asia War broke out, the people of Japan enthusiastically sang the patriotism song, recited it, and wrote it in the Manba collection, "Umi Yukaba Water-soaked Corpse Yukaba Kusamusu corpse | The patriotism of the emperor "Ohokimi" is the god of death "and" The patriotism of the ugly prince who doesn't care more than Kefu "is totally It has come to be overwhelmed by the population. Also, my senior friends, etc., published the patriotic songs one after another by the magazine, the book, and the radio broadcast, so even if I answer about the patriotic songs today, it would be a natural duplication. It's a patriotism, but even if it overlaps with each other, or even if the same song is reviewed many times, it doesn't mean that it's a patriotism. On the left, I tried to extract and place a patriotic song made by about ten people.

Uraura and Nodoki Yamazakura flowers that hang from the heart of spring (Mabuchi Kamo)
Shikishima's Yamatoshin is called "Human" Asahi Nihofuyama Zakurahana (Motoori Norinaga)
[# End of indentation here]
This is the same song that praises Sakura, which should be said to be a symbol of the empire's heart, but Mabuchi's song naturally comes out reasonably, and in particular, reveals something like "Yamato Kokoro". I can't say anything about it. The same song by Mabuchi says, "If you show it to a sorghum person, it's a mountain cherry blossom in the mountains of Yoshino in the sorghum field." Norinaga's song is already a well-known song and is popular with a summary to be popularized. By the way, I think that this degree of popularity was absolutely necessary for Norinaga's intention.
Patriotic gin, such as Hyakushu Tamashii, is in charge of the mission, and among them, "Mikuni is the country of goodness, the country of Urayasu, and the country of peace," "Momoyaso." There is no country in the book of the day, but there is no country in the book of the day. " ] And other songs. Almost all of these songs, including the Hyakushu and the singer, are old-fashioned songs that use ancient words in the horizontal direction, so it is not easy to understand the song of "Asahi nihofuyama Zakurahana". .. This is also made with the consciousness of Norinaga himself.
Mabuchi's song became more and more Manba-like from around the age of 60, and became purely old-fashioned, but Norinaga sang the song by dividing it into old-fashioned and near-style. The song of "Asahi Nihofu" is based on the recent song in it, and has a popular character that is easy for the general public to understand. The kaifu singing attitude is very important as an attitude, but it was absolutely necessary to preach the ideas of Kokugaku.

[# 3 indentation] Ibukizo Ayani Kashikoki, the god of Chiyorozu, who holds the ship down (Hiroshi Nakajima)
This is an anti-song of a long song that was made by looking at the Mongol invasion. , Kamikaze, Ibuki Dohashi, Tenun, Ioe no Iratsume, Tokoyami, Ohohita Mahite, Emishira, Konoha Nasu, Ibuki Hanachi, Roughness, * [# "Sanzui + Joke", 4th level 2-78-26] Metamaheba, Chiman's, Emishigatomo, Watatsumi's, not water waste "and so on.
Even in this tanka, Kamikaze is referred to as "God's Ibuki". This is also an expression of our country from the gods, and it sounds extremely appropriate even if we look at it now.
In the end, "Ayani Kashikoki" is awe-inspiring, and Manba also has "Kakemakumo Ayani Awe", the great god of the god of miracle.

[# 3 indentation] Mowing the sickle, the sickle of the sickle, the sickle of the sickle, the soul of the sickle, the soul of the sickle, Ahi no Tomo (Ahi Wada)
As the title of this song is "A song that praises the way of God," it is said that the teaching of the way of the imperial nation is neglected because of the thought of a foreign country. After expulsion, there was a long song saying, "Lead me on the road of Hiromichi, the politician of the Emperor God," and the anti-song is this one. Therefore, this one is also pierced with the same idea.
Even for a while, it is said that it is a good thing for comrades who have a good heart, so on top of that, it is in the form of a jokotoba, but it is not a sickle on the tone, but a place to cut the sickle grass. From the meaning of the sharp sickle, that is, the handle of the sickle, the sickle, and the sickle, the sickle, the sickle, the sickle, and the sickle. .. Since the poet at that time was also a national scholar, the poet was the most purely and naturally attracted to the predecessor.

[# 3 indentation] The enemy "Ata" Aramayaha (thousand kinds of merit) facing the arrowhead "Yasaki" of the country of Oho God.
There is a title called "Wuwei". It is a song that means that there is no foreign enemy who can sword at the tip of the soldiers of our empire, the mafu who worshiped Amaterasu Omikami and the gods of 800 million gods. In this article, "Iha" is a god of "Iha", which is a collection of Manba's nineteenth, "Makaji to Ofuna, and this chin, which is sent to Korea." Similar to the example of "Kami", it means "God to the god of peace and peace" (old meaning). It is a song that praises Japan as a country of heroism from the gods, and although the song tone is weak, it is still enough to be examined by the Greater East Asia War.
The title of Nahoko's work is "Muun Nagahisa", "The town of the eighty" Yaso "that will never be forgotten in the world to be ruled", "Human Nagaku Hisashimo", and "Yahatayama" cloud. There is a saying, "The road of the clouds". Mt. Hachiman here is Iwashimizu Hachimangu in Yamashiro, and it is a sacred lotus to Takegami.

Kamikaze, who didn't know the cleverness of Kamikaze, said "Goto", America Maru, "Amerika" (Maszumi Kamochi)
Mono no aware and America Maru | You don't know the fear of Kamikaze.
[# End of indentation here]
Perli came to Sagami Uraga in the 6th year of Kaei and moved people's hearts, but in the 7th year of Kaei (the first year of Ansei) he came to Uraga twice. It is the song at that time. In March of that year, the Kanagawa Treaty was made, but the Shogunate also had various difficulties. These two things are said to represent the hearts of the people at that time, and they say that America Maru and Mashiyama have been killed, and that you do not know the kamikaze of the empire. I'm fully open. This song is a work of seven heads, and other songs include "America Maru, who may regret it," and "Agana Hima, who knows sin quickly." "America Maru | Guy", "and shows a dignified life. If you look at these things, you can see that it was almost the same as the people who stood out just before the Greater East Asia Co., Ltd.

Asahi Susumera The person of the kingdom "Mikuni" is the beginning of the heaven "Ame" (Tachibana Moribe)
The country that dates back to Asahiko's "Mikuni" is the beginning of the country with the sun (same as above).
Yami Megumi's soup that falls from the height of the mountain
[# End of indentation here]
The first head has the title "heaven". Although it is a lyrical title, his national polity was reflected in the song. There is no beginning or end in "heaven", and there is no such thing as a humor in the situation, but in his faith, the heaven of the empire is the beginning of heaven. This is big and I like it very much. The second head is also the same idea, and it is said that the imperial nation that rises in the heavens is the forerunner of the nation of the setting sun, that is, Korea, Morokoshi and other Mangoku. It has the title "Country". The third head has the title "Shizuku", and he tried to get rid of the prince's Megumi Hirodai Mukai.

Sumeragi no Michi Leave only one place and others "Ada" and Komichi "Komichi" (Atsutane Hirata)
Awe-inspiring Okami "Okami" and "When" love the red heart "Ha" (same as above)
When the old "Furu" should be revered in the kingdom of the Emperor "Sumeragi" (same as above)
[# End of indentation here]
The first head has a poem that says, "By the decree of the Emperor Kotoku," but the royal decree of the Emperor Kotoku says, "Declaration [# 2] Tenjin Jiyo [# 1] 』\ Although there are so many things, I was struck. It is said that the imperial people should never be on the sidelines or on the outer roads by following this one "Sumeragi no Michi". 》 If you pray for the sincerity of my heart, Negahaku will go to the gods, so in the song I wrote at the same time, There is also a song called "Sumegami", the god of this. The third head is the one in which the self-made head was sewn on Hou Shimazu, and he was pleased that he headed for the luck recognized by the ancient roads of the empire.

[# 3 indentation] Outside of Michinoku, outside of Ezo, thinking about things from a boat rowing "Soto" (Sakuma Shozan)
This one is in Sakuma Shozan's emotional song, and it took ten years for Shozan to devise a defense for the empire, but he was not understood by the people at that time and was rejected. Because of that, he was accused of sin. Elephant Mountain uses the title from Mizu to say, "Kenken no Tadashi, I can't get a sneak peek."
The meaning of Isshu is that there is a central point in "Thinking about things", and it means that the empire is deeply conscious, and the first half of it is in the form of Jokotoba. However, it is not a meaningless Jokotoba, but because of the measures taken by the defense of Hokube, the phrase "rowing outside the outer Ezo of Michinoku" is naturally written by the author. I think it's something that floats in my consciousness.
Elephant mountain learned the song from Fumio Inoue, but since he made the song by incorporating the Manba style, this song also has its characteristics, and it is a tribute to the sound of melancholy.

[# 3 indentation] Yasushiji "Yashihoji" 輙 "Tayasu" Kuwataru sorghum sea castle Tefuna Yamameya (Yoshida Shoin)
This song was given to his uncle Tamaki Bunnoshin in the first year of Ansei (?), But foreign large steamships and warships that can easily cross the ocean must also be in our empire. .. This is also one of the decisions that must be placed without making it close to you.
Knowing this foreign country and trying not to lose to it, Sakuma Shozan mentioned above said, "I know that there is a possibility that I will be connected to Nochikao Ichikuni after 20 years. After thirty, I learned that it could lead to the world. Similar to "Knowing that there is something that will flourish in the Nochi Goshu world after forty", Matsuin wants Nochi Goshu to be in poverty, saying "Ikki Shinshu is a sword." After the mercy, he will be a prisoner in one room. " And, the idea of poverty for these five states is, "Let's live seven times and forget about the souls." It was written in the same way as the idea of "Dedicated Shigana".

[# 3 indentation] Ohokimi's Mitsuru, a shining day, a crazy day in the book "Motoyoshi", a Han Chinese in "Oso" (Motoyoshi Hiraga) )
There is a title of "Karafune" in this, but this song is not a poem, but the fact that the warships of foreign countries were eager to intimidate our country at that time. It must have been scolded.
It means that I don't know what kind of playful imitation the emperor's royal royal palace once made, foreigners with dementia. In the Manba collection, there is "Iza Children's Madness", "Tahawaza", "Ametsuchi", "Ametsuchi", and "Yamato Shimane", which contains the word "Tahawaza".
Naho, in the song of the original righteousness, "Become a shield of the prince and be strong, the end of" Masura "is more and more revered." Even though there are words such as "If you are a shield" and "Zarameyamo", the words "Great prince's shield" and "Kimi ga Shield" are included, which draws a pulse from Manba. You should be careful.

It is a sign to return to Yamato, a person of the world who is confused on the road of Totsukuni (Takamasa Oguni)
Even the sea of Yomo and the land of Hokiemishi are my prince's ones (same as above).
Emishira rushes the boat to the ocean and rushes to the ocean (same as above).
[# End of indentation here]
The first head should make a way to return to the right path for the people of the world who are enthusiastic about Chinese studies and Buddhism and deviate from the studies of the empire. I would like you to show the guidance policy. The second head is that there is no doubt that my prince's grace cannot be bathed in the seas on all sides, and even in the nations of the outer lands far away from the seas. The third head, that is, a song about the national thought of Kurofune and beyond, is a song that has been enthusiastic enough to fit into the current Greater East Asia War. The idea itself draws a pulse from around Norinaga, but it is quite good because of the sympathy of Perli and beyond.

The emperor "Ohokimi" will be a god.
The ugly shield of the emperor "Ohokimi" and the shield of the emperor "Ohokimi" will be taken, and the Masaki "Masaki" (same as above)
Arame and the sword of the emperor "Ohokimi" with a sword that is sworded by the sword "Mikoto Kashira" (same as above)

The one on the right is Tachibana Akemi's work, and most of it was given to those who are out in the field. It is said that there is a kind of song to give to those who came to the Saifu army, but I will omit it for now.
In Naho Akira, "Kuniburi, the god of Isagi, the person of Kuniburi, the god of the heart, and the person of Kamiguni," and "Sumeragi, the emperor," are unfamiliar. It is also in the same verse that he wrote a general emperor when he said, "Make your heart a vine or the road of our country."
Naho, "When you think about the teachings of God as a people of God's kingdom," he said, "#" Mouth + money ", 3rd level 1-15-5], etc. There are quite a lot of dawn songs. This was timely, but it was also timely.

[# 3 indentation] The life of the thing that was thrown away in the prince's edge is the life of the road (Tomoki Hatta)
This song is a song in memory of the person who died in the battle of the 蛤 辤 荤 in the first year of the Genji era. It is said that the life of the sword who gave his life to the prince is the true life of the sword, so the phrase "the life of the road" is a favorite phrase that seems to be a poet. Is. The songs of the late Shogunate and others were deeply moved and savvy, but it was regrettable that the words were not refined and the emotions could not be fully expressed. In the case of Saifu, this one is enough to satisfy Saifu's regret. The author of Nahoko said, "Only in the year of Yang Earth Dragon, I was a shield to the army and abandoned myself. The dew of Megumi, which extends to the end of Mandai, does not get wet with sleeves. " The content of this was sung in the lyrics, and the song became a sensational one.
