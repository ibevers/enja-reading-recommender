Preface
This essay is an attempt to explain the basic theory of Basic English, the outline of the organization, and its value in English education as plainly as possible. Basic is by no means limited to a 850-word list. It forms a dynamic and organic organization, and by its operation, it becomes a mechanism that can be envied for daily use. However, since Basic was devised according to the tradition of English and made full use of the peculiarities of English, the research is never useless from the perspective of English research. I don't think it is.
In Japan, it seems that people who have a good understanding of the Basic organization are relatively uncomfortable. Fortunately, this article helped the scholars to understand what Basic is like, and he spared no effort to discuss the relationship with him, and he was able to take a look at the organization of Basic as a whole. If I can take advantage of it and apply it to English education, I think it will not be limited to the happiness of the author.

To put it simply, what kind of English is Basic English? It is a complex idea that makes use of the vocabulary peculiarity of English, which has the greatest possibility of simplification in many places. However, it is an organic and organic organization obtained by rationally arranging large English so that it can be expressed only with the elemental vocabulary that is most necessary for human life consciousness. It should be said that it is a simplified small English that forms. Therefore, from the fact that English has the largest universal range in the world, Ogden (CK Ogden, 1889-), a linguistic psychologist in the British Chembridge, has the intention of making it an international auxiliary language that can be learned in a very short period of time. ―) It was devised as a result of many years of hard work.
There are 850 words that form the main body of the organization of Basic English, and if they are classified, 16 verbs named "operators", auxiliary verbs may (might), will (would) (and "actors"). Be, do, have are also used as auxiliary verbs), 100 words such as prefixes, adjuncts, adjectives, synonyms, adjuncts, 400 general thing names (nomenclature), and names of things that can be drawn in the 繪There are 200 words and 150 words (advocates) that express the nature (of which 50 words are good and bad; clean is dirty and express the meaning of rebellion). Tei. The grammar for operating these words is the same as in ordinary English, with a's' added to the multiple nouns and at the end of 300 nouns and a few adjectives (also used as verbs in ordinary English). Derivatives with'-er'('-or'),'-ing', and'-ed' (for example, support to supporter supporters, allies, supporters, supporting supporters) To make a supported (supported), supported (supported)), add'-ly' to the adjective for the adverb, use the endings of'-er','-est' for comparison, and'more Indicated by',' most'. You can use'-'s' or'of' to indicate possession, and add'un-'to some adjectives to create an adjective with the meaning of rebellion. Interrogative sentences use word change or'do', and verbs and pronouns are converted as usual. Alternatively, 250 plain idioms obtained by appropriately combining 850 words may be used. Weights and measures, numbers, coins, calendars and common words in all countries depend on English. In addition, 100 general scientific terms and 50 special terms such as various sciences and commerce are prepared.

* [# Roman numeral 2, 1-13-22]. Origin and development of the idea
To briefly describe the history of the organization of Basic English, Mr. Ogden wrote the famous book The Meaning of Meaning from 1919 to 1922 [# "The Meaning of Meaning" is italicized] *. ("The Meaning of Meaning", co-authored with Dr. Richards (IA Richards, 1893 ---)) dates back to the time of writing. In this book, the subtitle is "Study of the influence of language on the idea of ​​language and symbolism", and language is a kind of symbol, and its meaning is the language as a symbol. It is a detailed description of the theory that it is an action that directs, and the bottomless triangle (Chapter 1 of the same book) that discusses the relationship between the language, thought, and things is famous. That is, it is said that things and thoughts and thoughts and languages ​​have a direct relationship with each other, but things and a language have only an indirect relationship with each other. Thus, this triangle often has no bottom. In other words, the lines that connect the language as Simbol and things are often stretched. This is the reason why many mistakes occur on our everyday words. Because we not only wonder if there is a direct connection between Simbol and things, but also think that thinking is useful when using words. Is. If we reflect on the fact that the bottom of this triangle is stubborn, we say that we can avoid linguistic misunderstandings. This is studied by Matsuzo Kaito in comparison with Motoori Norinaga's "Koto, Kokoro, Kotoba" love triangle theory and Mitsue Fujitani's theory.

* The third edition of this book by Kotaro Ishibashi was published in 1945.
By the way, when Mr. Ogden, along with Mr. Richards and others, followed the research of the definition of the meaning of various words, some elemental words were always used in it. Take a look (although this was an intriguing issue in the seventeenth century, such as Leibnitz and John Wilkins), and was willing to use only these important basic vocabularies. , I came up with the idea that the meaning of many other words with complex content can be clearly stated. Going further, I started my research considering that it would be possible to compose a kind of basic English using only these elemental vocabularies. Thus, the idea of ​​an international language in English, which facilitates the exchange of ordinary ideas, was already one of Mr. Ogden's main affairs. At the same time, at that time, many obstacles seemed to lie ahead of his attempt. For example, even if such an international auxiliary language was devised at the expense of ten years, I wonder if there would be many difficulties in using it, even if it was more difficult than in the early days. I was wondering if it would be possible to create something that would give the eyes and ears a natural impression of ordinary English.
However, Mr. Ogden eventually found the key to solving these problems. He also praised Die Philosophie des Als Ob [# "Die Philosophie des Als Ob" is an oblique body] 1 (The philosophy of'As if') by Hans Vaihinger (1852-1933. German philosopher). He published the English book 2 in 1924, but from that time on, he became more and more aware of the need for research on the linguistic philosophy of Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832. British law and philosopher), and began to enthusiastically admire Vaihinger. It was. At that time, Mr. Ogden was studying the nature of verbs, but he was greatly encouraged by the suggestions obtained from Bentham's linguistic view, and he was able to proceed with further debate and finally reach his intended purpose. It was. "Bentham's Theory of Fictions provided an invaluable help in the final stages of the work of devising Basic. For the purpose of calling the so-called verb organization an international language. Bentham's support for the idea that it could be dismantled, at least, made me decide to make this attempt. Therefore, Bentham is the true father of Basic English. 1 "Mr. Ogden says. The idea of ​​fictitious (making things that are not facts into facts, making things) is a problem that has been noted by many ancient philosophers such as Kant and Niche, but especially in British law and political philosophy. Vaihinger also says that he has played an even more important role in the philosophical and philosophical aspects of other nations. Thus, Mr. Ogden developed the theory of Bentham's "Linguistic Fictions" and applied it to the truth, and the result finally appeared in Basic English. Bentham was thus the first to insist on the possibility of organizing English into an international language by his linguistic theory, and the word international was his first use. In the first place, Bentham's motivation for "linguistic fiction" was partly due to his thoughts on the horror of his childhood ghosts. And, on the other hand, it was due to the dislike of "Legal Fictions" 2 (Legal Fictions), which was evoked by a lecture by Sir William Blackstone (1723-80) in Oxford. It was. That is, the suspicions behind the words spectres, imps, and bogeys, and the moral significance behind the legal terms, go further. So, I moved on to the basic discussion of the language itself. 3

By the way, Bentham's "linguistic fiction" is, in short, some languages ​​that indicate the incorporeal things that can be clearly pointed to by'table' and'dog', but also by'liberty,''. Some, such as obligation,''civilization', are not ephemeral and exist only in words, that is, they refer to abstract fiction. Therefore, what is called the latter is called "linguistic fiction". Mr. Ogden said, "There are many nouns (for example, harmony, quality, etc.) that do not represent concrete things at all. However, in all national languages, concrete things are shown for convenience. These are the names of fictional things. These words are not a special problem in terms of grammar, but what is called a language. This distinction is important if one wants to understand what it is .... The nature of linguistic fiction is probably even easier to understand if one considers it as a type of metaphor. A metaphor is, in the ordinary sense, the application of a word to something similar, that is, fiction is to exert the function of a word on something similar. , The force of circumstance is a similar usage borrowed from the world of physicists, but force itself cannot find a metaphor in the universe, even when physicists use it. " *When.

In the use of words, we often confuse the words that indicate the body with the words that indicate the imaginary, without clearly recognizing the difference between these two languages, by traditional practice. I will use it. Even if the speaker and the listener use the same words for that purpose, the meanings of the words that each thinks about may be inconsistent, which may lead to the exchange of ideas. , Mix our ideas. However, we tend to prefer to use these fictional words as literary. This is about the magic of words. Many of the so-called philosophies are merely a reflection of our linguistic habits, and the controversy is also the result of the illusion of language, Ogden said. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the meaning of the word that indicates the imagination and clarify its meaning with a collection of more sensible and elemental words, and it is possible in English to do so. It is an important part of his hermeneutics, and at the same time, it forms the main basis for the idea of ​​Basic English.

* [# Roman numeral 3, 1-13-23]. Principles of vocabulary restriction
1. Elimination of verbs
The most fictional and astringent nature of the words, so-called ゞ, shorthand 號, etc. are verbs. Thus, verbs are the most difficult and troublesome to learn in all national languages. One of the most prominent examples is'decimate', which means "kill one in ten". In Basic, this is analyzed as'put to death one man out of every ten'and paraphrased. 'disembark' (landing) is dismantled into three parts,'get off a ship'. In the same way,'ascend' is'go up','descend' is'go down','traverse' is'go across', and'penetrate' is' Go into','eradicate'to'take up by the roots','precede' to'go in front of','disappear' to'go Reduced to from view'. In this way, a verb is a combination of origin, action and object, or action and direction. Therefore, in Basic, the 16 most basic verbs (give, get; take, put; come, go; keep, let; make, say, see, send, do, have, be and seem ), Calling it "operators", and the 20 most basic "directives" (or adverbs) about, across, after, against, among , at, before, between, by, down, from, in, off, on, over, through, to, under, up, with are combined to make other verbs work. Mr. Ogden says that by this method, the result of the experiment is to eliminate 4,000 ordinary verbs. All of these 16 "actions" represent simple tangible movements and are extremely easy to understand. It can be said that even ordinary English cannot be established as English without using these verbs. It is one of the most difficult English verbs. These basic verbs are often used in workarounds, but they are also extremely universal and combine with other words to perform a great many functions.
It can be said that this decomposing way of saying is almost possible only in English. This is the reason why English is most suitable for the purpose of simplification. Organizations that rely on end-to-end conversions extremely hinder the simplification of words, and the tendency of the underlying Latin language to be noticeable in modern Latin national languages. However, as its historical history shows, English gradually progressed more comprehensively and analytically, and finally reached modern English, which was purified with almost no conjugation, that is, no conjugation, with prepositions and auxiliary verbs. This is because it has become a substitute for this. It can be said that modern English is similar to Chinese at this point. Basic took advantage of this major feature of English. There are two ways to express the same meaning in English. That is, the comprehensive ones that came from Latin and French and the analytical ones that came from English. It is also a pity that Basic, which utilizes this latter, can be said to be idiomatic as English.
The following short story * written in Basic clearly shows the function of the "direction" that accompanies the "action".
The dog went―
After [# "after" is italic] the rat,

[# Indent two characters from here]
(The dog chased the mouse, passed by the sewage, crossed the street, crossed the fence, and went with the fly from the doorway to the meat, contrary to the rules. The fly entered the meat and entered the mouth. The poison went down the throat and entered between the muscles. During digestion, the poison left the flies and spilled into the flesh. Throughout, after surgery, before death, the sewage was disturbed.)
[# End of indentation here]
For some of these words, it is more correct to say a word that expresses a place or position in space rather than a word that expresses a direction.
Now, if you translate the above sentence with so-called verbs,
The dog―
'Pursued' the rat,
'Passed' the drain,
'Crossed' the street,
And'climbed' the wall,
'Bearing' the fly;
It'entered' the door,
'Broke' the rules,
And'approached' the meat.
The fly―
'Invaded' the meat,
'Penetrated' the mouth,
'Descended' the throat,
And'infested' the muscles.
The poison―
'Left' the fly,
'Attacked' the digestion,
And'permeated' the system.

At the same time, sometimes "direction" is used along with so-called verbs. That is,
The noise―
'Emanated' from [# "from" is italic] an instrument,
'Located' under [# "under" is italic] the window,
'Proceeded' up [# "up" is italic] the steps,
And'diffused' itself through [# "through" is italic] the hospital,
Where it'worked' on [# "on" is italic] the young man's nerves,
'Following' as it did, after [# "after" is italic] his operation.
In the above ordinary English sentence, there are 21 verbs that have "action" and "direction" in them, respectively, but in Basic, they are called come, go, and get. You can see that it is replaced by three "action words". Thus, there are 4,000 ordinary verbs in English that are thus replaced by 16 "activists".
Furthermore, as an example of verb exclusion, the Basic of Gettysburg Speech, which is famous as a classic of Lincoln's English speech, is shown below in light of the original text.
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their. lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so n obly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
Seven and eighty years have gone by from the day when our fathers gave to this land a new nation―a nation which came to birth in the thought that all men are free, a nation given up to the idea that all men are equal. Now We are fighting in a great war among ourselves, testing if that nation, or any nation of such a birth and with such a history, is able long to keep united. We are together on the field of a great event in that war. have come to give a part of that field as a last resting-place for those who went to their death so that that nation might go on living. It is in every way right and natural for us to do this. But in a wider sense we have no power to make this place an offering in their name, to give any mark of our respect, any sign of our belief. Those men, living and dead, who had no fear in the fight, have given it a name far greater than our poor power to make additions or to take away. The future will take little note of what we say here; will not long keep it in but what they did here will never go from memory. It is for us, the living, to give ourselves here to the work which is not ended, which they who were in the fight have taken forward to this point so well. is for us to give ourselves here to the great work which is still before us, so that from these dead who are in our hearts we may take an increased love of the cause for which they gave the last full measure of their love; so that we may here come to the high decision that these dead will not have given themselves to no purpose; so that this nation, under the Father of All, may have a new birth in the hope to be free; and so that government of all, by all, and for all, may not come to an end on the earth. [# Here is the end of italics] *
* C.K. Ogden: Basic English and Grammatical Reform [# "Basic English and Grammatical Reform" is italic] (1937), p.74
[# In the bottom book, there is a Japanese translation of Lincoln's speech by Tadao Yanaihara, but Tadao Yanaihara's copyright is currently under protection, so I will omit it. ]
This Lincoln speech is generally considered to be one of the purest prose in English, but there are still 25 verbs that Basic has excluded. That is, bring, conceive, dedicate, create, engage, can, endure, meet, live, fit, shall, consecrate, hallow, struggle, add, detract, note, remember, forget, fight, advance, remain, resolve, die, perish. Besides that, there are 30 * words that Basic had to find alternative phrases. Moreover, you can see that these words are used repeatedly several times.
* Score, age, forth, continent, liberty, proposition, civil, whether, battle, portion, final, life, altogether, proper, large, ground, brave, above, world, nor, rather, unfinished, thus, nobly, task , honoured, devotion, vain, freedom, people.
By the way, one of the principles of substitution is to use "action" in combination with "direction" as a substitute for verb, but such composition is in standard English from the 15th century onwards. In the meantime, English now has a lot of idioms assembled in this way that are not unsightly. Thus, they play a substitute role for all important verbs in the use of "activists". The reason why Basic brought a remarkable change to the verb organization by expanding the usage of this substitute form is for the purpose of saving linguistic waste. The verb form is one of the major obstacles to the attempt to simplify the linguistic language, and it is not widely used as a linguistic device. Therefore, for some people, the verb form poses a difficult task that cannot be conquered from the beginning. On the other hand, for those who are accustomed to the complexities of the verb form, the irregular form of the foreign language imposes an excessive burden on memory. Another rebuttal is that verbs contain useless vocabulary in the early stages of learning. However, if you make full use of "action words", you can make nouns and adjectives work twice as much. Finally, and thus this is a more fundamental problem, verbs are, in the same way as in the case of abbreviated writing style, a mixture of ideas at the stage of the action of words expressing meaning. It is easy to come.
In Basic, 16 "action words" and 20 "direction words" are combined, and put in = insert (* [# The vertical bar made by "插" penetrates down, 4th level 2-13-28] Enter), it is possible to immediately create something that is compatible with an extremely large number of verbs, but in ordinary English vocabulary, 90% of its usage is incomprehensible. It is made up of many synonyms that have a distinction at the end. While this increased the stylistic value of English, it made the learning particularly difficult for foreigners. However, put in is a substitute for many other verbs in each special case. For example, put (a word) in = interject, put (an account) in = render, put (the tea) in = infuse, put (the sheep) ) In = fold, put (a request) in = file, put (a seed) in (the earth) = plant (sow), put (the baby) ) In (the bath) = immerse, put (things) in (a house) = install, etc. Kaifu Kotohi * [# "廴 + 囘", 4th level 2-12-11] If you usually need a special word in ordinary English, at first glance in Basic It is possible to obtain clear analytical synonyms. Moreover, in the case of a sword, add at least one so-called idiom (like the 250 idioms shown in The ABC of Basic English [# "The ABC of Basic English" is italicized]). Nor does it increase the difficulty of pronunciation for foreigners at all.
Speaking of operation, it is the simplest and most common of everyday life, when one thing works on another, or when humans work on something else, as well as the basic physical action. This is called operation even in the case of daily activities. At the same time, the most common movement is to move, and to push and to pull are now a little special movements. Even in the case of human beings, the most common movements are moving, pushing, and pulling in the same way, and there are also put and take. Something a little more special than these are give and get. Therefore, there are two types of animal movements: come and go. Then there are make, keep, let ... and allow to do. Fortunately, in Basic, to move, to push, and to pull can be paraphrased with the help of nouns. That is,
Move = Give (a thing) a move, 1 or put (a thing) in motion.
Push = Give a push to (a thing).
Pull = Give a pull to (a thing).
1 Bentham prefers to use verb-like nouns when people use verbs, and for example, to move is called to give motion. The reason is that the noun motion is considered as if it is an italic "thing", and its meaning becomes clear (CK Ogden: Bentham's Theory of Fictions [# "Bentham's Theory". "of Fictions" is italic], Introduction, cvii).
Therefore, at the moment, if you add the usage of be (existence), seem (an appendix of the meaning of rebellion to be) and have (own) to the ten "action words" as "action words". Then, all the necessary things will come out. Now that we've talked about verb exclusion in Basic, let's talk about the other vocabulary restrictions that Basic has taken.
2 C.K. Ogden: Basic English [# "Basic English" is italicized], pp.53-7.
2. Elimination of luxury words
Basic started organizing the vocabulary before the construction, saying that if the restricted vocabulary was effective as an international auxiliary language and as a tool for English education, it would be possible to make it in time with 1,000 words or less. We chose 7,500 of the most useful vocabularies, and based on that, we came up with the elimination of 4,000 ordinary verbs. At the same time, due to the primary restrictions on other vocabularies, 1,500 words were reduced to 2,000 words. After further scrutiny, I finally got 850 Basic words. It is said that if the number of words is less than this, the wording as English will be extremely unreasonable. Therefore, in the investigation of the basic vocabulary, the behavior of the word can be clearly known, and its usage value can be determined extremely accurately. The Panoptic Eliminator shown on the next page, that is, the radial chart (radial chart). I clarified the Panoptic Chart) and used it.
[# Enter the captioned figure (fig18361_02.png) of "Radiation type chart"]
Put the words to be examined first in the 圓 in the center of the above radiation chart. Next, on each radiation, we will discuss the relationship with other words that should be substituted for that word. Thus, these other words are put at the tip of radiation. To give a simple example now, if the word dog is placed in the central circle, the word that can replace dog in the Time (Age) relationship is puppy. At the same time, puppy is unnecessary. This is because if there is a dog and the adjective young for Time (Age), then puppy = young dog. As for Behavior (Sex), when female is included in the Basic word table, bitch = female dog, and bitch is no longer necessary. Thus, in each detail, the various words related to dog are discussed, and finally dog ​​is adopted as the basic word. In the same way, gale, physicalian, and crowd are removed. This is because it is possible to express words with basic words such as strong wind, medical man, and a great number, respectively. In most cases, the meaning of other words can be expressed by the method of description and the word indicating the amount. Also, using the opposition definition method, it is often possible to express the meaning of ignorance by using knowledge and the meaning of courage by using fear. 1. Also, an abstract so-called fictional word, for example,'liberty' is a condition of being free, and'civilization' is a combination of simple and more adjective basic words such as stage of development in society, society in high stage of development. , Many adjectives that express their meaning and are colored more than necessary by emotions, such as'picturesque,''sublime' are often thoughts and emotions * [# two-letter, 1 -2-22] Since it can be separated, it can be said frankly as pleasing to the eye, like a picture, (very) beautiful. Also, select a word with a large application range from a group of words with similar meanings, form rather than shape, help (helper, helping, helped) than assistance, harder and more difficult than difficult. Hard work, a hard question, a hard man (a hard wood, [# "a hard wood" is "ah ard wood" in the bottom line]) is adopted. Next, let's talk about this.
1 For details, see C.K. Ogden: Opposition [# "Opposition" is italicized], 1932. (Psyche Min.).
3. Meaning expansion and specialization
"Meaning expansion" is the figurative use of the original meaning of a word for something similar to it. Therefore, this can be said to be an exhibition of Bentham's "fictional theory" in the treatment of metaphors. However, in Basic, in order to avoid abuse of this usage, we will add restrictions to the category, take advantage of learning, organize and classify in a rational and easy-to-understand manner, and prepare for utilization. There is. He says that he has a bad pain in his head [# "head" is italic] (head). From The new head [# "head" is italic] (principal) of our school seems to have a clear brain. From Living in a clean [# "clean" is italic] (clean) house makes us healthy. To Though he has no religion, he has a clean [# "clean" is italic] (clean) mind. The meaning is expanded. Another example, Card-playing is a waste [# "waste" is italic] of time. To get such a thing would be only a waste [# "waste" is italic] of money. → Put all the waste [# "Waste" is italic] in the bucket. That bit of land is nothing but a waste [# "waste" is italic] of sand. The arm is wasting [# "wasting" is Italic] slowly (arms gradually lose weight). Rubber is an elastic [# "elastic" is italic] (elastic) substance. → He has very elastic [# "elastic" is italic] (flexible) views about the question. (Also as a nomenclature, Put a bit of elastic [# "elastic" is italic] (rubber string) round the rolled paper.)
2 C.K. Ogden: The Basic Words; a detailed account of their uses [# "The Basic Words; a detailed account of their uses" is italicized] (Psyche Min.).
Thus, in Basic, a general word that is flexible in the concrete and abstract directions is selected. At the same time, the words whose inflections do not change depending on the part of speech are used as much as they appear as each part of speech. This is a vocabulary economy and has the benefit of avoiding mistakes for beginners in its use. For example, The army went forward [# "forward" is italic] (secondary) without loss of time. The forward (shape) part of the ship was greatly damaged. * He is quite a forward (shape, precocious) boy. We have equal (shape) amount of money. A fight between equals (name, equals) is interesting to see. Other adjectives used as nouns are acid, chief, chemical, cold, complex, cut, fat, female, first, flat, future, good (s), hollow, last, living, male, material, opposite, parallel. , past, present, public, quiet, right, safe, same, second, secret, solid, sweet, waiting, wet, wrong, young and color adjectives. "Specialization of meaning" means that the meaning of a word is limited to a certain case and is used for a certain special meaning. For example, they gave the baby a powder [# "a powder" is italic] at the hospital. To mean "powder", we do nothing in the heat [# " "The heat" is italicized] but go to sleep. It is also the same to use cover as "lid" and competition as "match".
* If you show other usage of Damage, they are looking at the damage [# "damage" is italic] done by the strong wind yesterday. He has a damaged [# "damaged" is italic] finger He made a damaging [# "damaging" is italic] statement about her book. He got 1,000 yen damages [# "damages" is italic] (damage compensation) Like from the company.
Mr. Ogden said about the use of these meanings. * There are two main ways to expand the meaning of nouns and other words. That is, it is "stretching" and "specialization". Meaningfulness is the use of a word that represents one or more things on one or more things that have something to do with it. The relationship may be a relationship that covers the entire part. For example, a letter meaning "letter" is replaced by a letter meaning "letter". It may also be related to the consequences of the cause. For example, bite is used to describe the action of "biting" and the "bitten object". In addition, it may show the relationship with the person who went to work. For example, lift "Frying" means "Frying thing (elevator)". Thus, metaphor is a kind of special form of meaning, and the word for a group of things that contains a certain relationship, the word for a similar relationship, and the other group of things. Is to apply to. In the basic vocabulary, words such as tenacity (relentless, stubborn) and scheme (plan, scheme) are excluded, and the words'the grip of a disease,''designs for the future' You can say it.
* Basic English [# "Basic English" is italicized], pp. 45-6.
"Specialization" is the use of a word with a broad meaning to give it a special meaning. For example, the word send in an account means send in a bill. Also, when we read the article'the death of a famous judge'in the newspaper, we are wondering whether the judge is a horse judge, a liquor judge, or a 繪 畫 judge. Instead, we immediately know that we are legal judges, or judges. "Specialization" is, in a sense, limiting, but it leads to the removal of words that have very conjugations from the whole vocabulary. The vocabulary conjugation range will be expanded.
4. Compound words
By connecting nouns and others in a suitable manner, for example, camera-man (photographer, camera operator), coal-house (coal storage), house-coal (household coal), account-book (gold account book), The motion picture house is also a characteristic of English, but Basic makes great use of this method. Say word-book instead of dictionary and baby-carriage instead of perambulator. The creation of this compound word is a very wealthy territory for the production of new words.
Other examples: -cupboard, cow-house, copyright, handwriting, downfall, income, inside, outside, good-looking, outcome, outlet, outline, outlook, sundown, overcome, undergo, undertake, upkeep, upright, without, etc. 1.
1 C.K. Ogden: The ABC of Basic English [# "The ABC of Basic English" is italicized], (Psyche Min.) Pp. 54-7.
5. Ends of -er, -ing, -ed
In Basic, the 300 nouns 2 (which are also used as verbs in ordinary English) are suffixed with'-er (or -or)''-ing' and'-ed'. It is possible to create a derivative word and use it. Thus,'-er' represents a person or thing that acts as a human being, and the'-ing'form is used as an adjective and noun, and the'-ed'form is used as an adjective. As a result, the range of conjugation of words is broadened and the convenience of writing style is obtained. In addition, in Basic, it is a tatemae that does not allow verb-like functions other than the prescribed 16 "actions", but for the convenience of writing style, allow forms such as I am printing a book.ゐ. Mr. Ogden says about this. "It should be said that it is a natural tendency for a word in the -ing form to be accompanied by a noun that is acted upon by it, rather than the active meaning of the -ing form. (I am printing. What?). A book.) This is not a follow-up to the verb idioms for Basic, and the traditional explanations such as'the direct object in the accusative'are clearly inappropriate. At the same time, the use of the -ing form of the word is for convenience in terms of grammar, and for beginners, the following alternative form is not difficult.
Acting a play = Getting a play acted. Doing a play. Putting a play on the stage.
Airing dresses = Giving dresses an airing. Getting dresses aired.
Answering letters = Giving answers to letters. Getting letters answered. Writing in answer to letters.
Attacking a town = Making an attack on a town.
2 Basic English [# "Basic English" is italicized], p. 48.
Also, the ending of -ed is completely adjective (a printed book, a book printed in London), so it should not be used as a past form of a verb. " *
* Basic English [# "Basic English" is italicized], p. 49.
6. Formulaic language
Basic idioms are 250 plain English idioms obtained by properly combining 850 words in order to make the expression of thoughts and feelings smooth and concise. The ABC of Basic English [# "The ABC" "of Basic English" is categorized and shown in [Slanted] with example sentences. These are given to learners to complete the Basic organization after becoming familiar with the basic meanings and usages of the 850 words. In addition, 250 more idioms (also in combination of 850 words) familiar to Anglo-Americans for Basic essays are marked with ** in The Basic Words [# "The Basic Words" is italicized]. Is shown. Here are the 50 most needed idioms in Basic (among the first 250).
at [# "at" is italic] war (work, play, rest), bad (good, quick, working) at [# "at" is italic], by [# "by" is italic] force, by [# "By" is italic] himself, respect (love, feeling) for [# "for" is italic], responsible for [# "for" is italic], but for [# "for" is italic], different from [# "From" is italic], in [# "in" is italic] motion, in [# "in" is italic] use (operation), out of [# "of" is italic] the room, control (grip) of [# "Of" is italic] [# "control (grip) of [#" of "is italic]" is "control, grip of [#" of "is italic]"], full of [# "of" "Is italic], off [#" off "is italic] his head, farther on [#" on "is italic], (go, keep, get) on [#" on "is italic] [#" farther on [ # "On" is italic], (go, keep, get) on [# "on" is italic] "is" farther on [# "on" is italic] (go, keep, get on [# "on" "Is italic])"], worked out [# "out" is italic], go (turned) over [# "over" is italic], be able to [# "to" is italic], put up [# "" up "is italic] with, angry (pleased) with [#" with "is italic], come [#" come "is italic] to a stop, get [#" get "is italic] (a book) out, get [# "Get" is italic] out of doing, give [# "give" is italic] up, go [# "go" is italic] to sleep, (guns) go [# "go" is italic] off, ( lights) go [# "go" is italic] out, have [# "have" is italic] an effect on, let [# "let" is italic] a house, make [# "make" is italic] ] Up a story, put [# "put" is italic] off (meeting), as [# "as" is italic] if, one another [# "another" is italic], there [# "there" is italic] is, in addition [# "addition" is italic] to, in the belief [# "belief" is italic], in bits [# "bits" is italic], in memory [# "memory" is italic] of, take part [# "part" is italic] in, take place [# "place" is italic], put a stop [# "stop" is italic] to, give way [# "way" is italic] to, in (out of) the way [# "way" is italic], at right angles [# "angles" is italic], dependent [# "dependent" is italic] on, good [# "good" is italic] morning (day, night ), at present [# "present" is italic], tired [# "tired" is italic] of, dear [# "dear" is italic] Mr. A., 10 years old [# "old" is italic].
Based on the above principles, the 850 words of Basic were selected as a result of further detailed study. In January 1929, the Orthological Institute of British Chembridge conducted the selection of Italic Psychology. As you can see at a glance on one page of the international magazine Psyche [# "Psyche" is italicized], it was first revealed, and the following year, in 1930, Basic English [# "Basic English" is italicized] was published. .. Next, 50 common languages ​​were decided. Thus, as mentioned earlier, from the standpoint of an international auxiliary language, Basic reduces the number of words as much as it appears, covers the words most necessary for human life consciousness, and has a simple grammar. He tried to meet the requirements of being regular and easy to learn, and at the same time to make it follow ordinary English grammar. Thus, it can be used for more ordinary purposes such as commerce, industry, and science. Therefore, the Basic 850 words selected based on such consideration are completely different from the word table selected based on the frequency of the idioms. It goes without saying that the 850 words are extremely ordinary English, but they were selected mainly by focusing on the usage value of the words. There was no particular emphasis on spelling length or Anglo-Saxon or Latino vocabulary. Therefore, it can be said that Basic forms a small English language that includes almost all kinds of English words.
[#New Page]
* [# Roman numeral 4, 1-13-24]. Basic selection
As a result of research, a method of properly expressing the meanings of ordinary movements and things that are not included in Basic by using the 850 words has been prepared. Therefore, from the beginning, the learner may pay special attention to these. Therefore, it is obvious from the top of the organization that the most inconvenient part of Basic is the case of a word that expresses an action. This is because the verb form must somehow be expressed. Since the Basic organization is based on nouns, I haven't the smallest idea what became of him. I haven't the smallest idea what became of him. It is my belief that we will have snow. I say this for your amusement. Let me have a wash (a bath, a smoke, a drink, a swim). She gave his hand a cold touch. He gave a little laugh. He took a long breath. Etc.). Therefore, if you become proficient in using have, give, make, take, get, etc., it will be easy to operate. I think it's similar to the use of Sa line in this Japanese language. Professor Kochi Doi explained the basic Japanese verbs that he devised, saying, "When we study Latin and Greek, the most difficult thing to feel is the conversion of working words, but in Japan. In terms of words, there are many kinds of working words such as four-stage conjugation, upper two-stage, lower two-stage, upper one-stage, and lower one-stage conjugation, which makes Japanese very difficult. . I use the words "to live", "to organize", "to educate", "to study", and "to record". I took in about 200 words, made them regular verbs, and made the number of other verbs as small as possible to make Japanese easier. Incorporated about fifty words of work that are not verbs, but according to the following method, the words of work are "do, become, have, go, put". There will be only twenty innocent. Thinking-thinking, knowing-knowing, writing-writing, flying-going in the sky, swimming-swimming, buying ――Buy, put out ――Put in, enter ――Go home, it is convenient for Westerners to use the word of work as the first word, The Japanese don't have to do that. Therefore, I tried to keep the basic words not too far from the standard words, and kept about fifty irregular verbs. "* From the point of view of the basic language, it is possible to know the common ounce that exists between the Japanese, English, and Japanese languages.
* "Purification of Japanese language and basic language" (Japanese language science course, May 1945, Meiji Shoin, pp. 7. 9. 10.)
Next, some of the words and phrases necessary for daily life used in Basic are shown. Therefore, it goes without saying that there are various ways of saying it other than those illustrated in the 茲. It should be noted that the use of these terms is not difficult for Basic learners. Also, it is extremely easy for those who have already learned English to get used to it.

3. Other precautions, ――
(1) A phrase that expresses the meaning of'Can,'' ought,'' must,''shall',
[# Indent from here]
Be able to ......, it is possible for me to ......, get (have, there is) a chance of ......-ing; it is right (wise) for me to do ......, it is my business to do ......, have to ......, it is necessary for me to ......, be forced to ... ....
[# End of indentation here]
If Shall is not an interrogative sentence, it will be expressed by will. At the same time, "Am I going to do it or not?" Or "Am I wise to do it?"
Will * is an auxiliary verb that means that the action can be performed unprecedentedly, but if it is stressed again, it can be used to express a decision or intention. Would is used not only for will's past, but also for the future of the mood. For example, All would now be well if you had come. In Basic, there is no distinction between shall and will. And since most people who speak Standard English are innocent at this point, in most cases, using will instead of shall will not be noticed. At the same time, as in the case of Shall I go ?, in the interrogative sentence that means Is it your desire that ......, Am I wise to ......, Is it necessary. , From the point of view, it is better to use the substitute form as described above. Since the separation between Shall and will cannot be made, it is not necessary to consider the separation between should and would as long as it matches the case of shall and will. At the same time, should has three usages that are not included in the usage of shall, and it is necessary to find alternative terms for these.
* Basic English [# "Basic English" is italicized], pp. 58-9.
[# Indent one character from here, indent and indent five characters]
It is right for you to do your best. Instead of You should do your best.
b. The order was that I was to go. Or ... for me to go. Or My order was to instead of The order was that I (or he) should go. go.
c. If he should come, we should go. Instead of If he should come, we should go.
[# End of indentation here]
(2) A phrase that expresses the meaning of'Each,''altogether,''whole,''few,'' many,''too,''once',
Use every one (separately) for'Each', quite or completely for'altogether', the'whole' group is all the group, and the'whole' story is the complete story. a'few' men can often be said to be two or three men. At the same time, it is safer to say a small number (of) when you are not sure. Use a great number (of) or quite a number (of) for'many'. 'too many' is more than enough and'too tired' is over-tired. And He is'too' tired to go. Says He is so tired that he is unable to go. He is tired and ill'too.' Is He is tired and ill in addition. Or He is not It says only tired but ill. 'once' is said to be at one time or in the past.
(3) Words that express the meaning of'Ago,''already,''yet,''since,''next,''always,''unless', etc.
A long time'ago' means a long time back or in the old days, and'already' means in the past or before. When you say "by now", you may use so far or up to now. Also, those who have come to "already" ('already') are now (now). At the same time, if he has not come to the "yet" ('yet'), he is not in the arrow (still). That is, He is not there'yet.' Becomes He is still not there. Or So far he has not come. "That's it" ('and yet') has the meaning of at the same time. You can say that there is no for a long time for a friend who has no "since" last year. At that time, the incident that occurred "since" is the same as saying that it occurred after then. At the same time, when it comes to declining "kara" ('since'),'since' has the meaning of because. "Next" ('next') To be an old man is to be an old man after this. At the same time, the time to "next" ('next') it is the time to regain it (again). Then the house that is "next" here is the house closest to it. "Always" is usually expressed as at all times. Also, I'd never ask you ('always') to be your friend, and it's even more appropriate to use for ever, especially when you're thinking about the future. Without change and without end are appropriate phrases to express similar meanings. The phrase "if not ..." ('unless') can be simply expressed with if and not. For example, It will not be done'unless' I do it. Becomes It will not be done if I do not do it.
(4) Words that express the meaning of'busy,''deaf,''world,''life,''husband', etc.
A "busy" person can simply say a man with much business. At the same time, it is generally more appropriate to say He is working hard. Or He has much to do. A "deaf" person is a person whose hearing is evil. The "world" is the earth when we talk about the whole earth we live in. At the same time, if you are surprised "all over the world", use everyone. In a different sense, for example, "the world" can be said to be things or conditions. What has "life" ('life') is what has existence. At the same time, when'life'is used to mean something that has "life", that is, a living thing, it is called living things or all living things. 'life' "life" can be expressed even in living. For example, Living is interesting. The'husband'is generally referred to as a married man. At the same time, when it comes to the sentence, other words may be more convenient. For example, her first'husband' can be said to be the man she was first married to. At the same time, when asking How is your'husband'to-day ?, Basic says How is Mr. X to-day ?. When using Basic in this way, it is necessary to first consider what is the key to what you say.

* [# Roman numeral 5, 1-13-25]. Basic and English education
(1) In learning a foreign language, trying to appeal only to memorization ability and mechanically reminding the learner is often a burden on the learner's memory. , 1-2-22] Not only does it cause disgust, but it does not take into account the characteristics of foreign language professors who train their thinking skills. It is extremely unfavorable for the mental abilities of adolescents. However, since Basic considers the meaning analytically due to the nature of its origin, it requires the utilization of thinking ability. This Basic is extremely dynamic. In English and Japanese, there is a tendency to end the Noh performance by giving only so-called verbatim without paying attention to the meaning and context of the original text. Also, the paraphrase is almost the same. One of the purposes is to make people understand new expressions by using paraphrases, but the most important purpose is to understand the text. Therefore, if the paraphrase becomes more difficult than the text, it can be said that the value of the paraphrase has been halved. However, since Basic has a limited number of words and must utilize only elemental vocabulary, it does not allow a method using only mechanical techniques to translate with synonyms of the same level. It is absolutely necessary to dig deeper into the interior, logically analyze the meaning of the original text, and investigate it well. Therefore, I always keep in mind the meaning of the whole sentence. Therefore, it is possible to test the student's strength by translating ordinary English into Basic. Therefore, Basic is convenient for practicing in various places because its language organization is simple. Richards emphasized this from the English professor's experience at Chembridge and Harvad's university, using a passage from The New Republic [# "The New Republic" is italicized] as an example, and Basic. I will explain it with you. The original text is
[# Indent from here]
I brief, the educational significance of modern social development is to emphasize the need for a liberated intelligence. This in turn requires, first, a reorganization of educational intervention so that theory may operate freely on the level of practice, and, secondly, a consideration of the question of whether and to what extent we are willing to accept the principle of a free intelligence as a basis for our social outlook or philosophy of life.
[# End of indentation here]
However, the Basic translation here is
[# Indent from here]
┌i education on developments in society
To put it shortly, the effects of ┤
└ii developments in society on education
make clearer (greater) the need for minds which are free (which have been made free).
These we will not get without, first, a new organization of the ways (instruments, workers) in education, by which theory may be put into use (may become a guide to our acts) without trouble (being stopped, waste). second, it is necessary to give an answer to the question: Are we ready, and how far are we ready, to take the free operation of thought as the general rule controlling our outlook on society (as men in society) or our theory of what is right (our beliefs, our ideas, and acts).
[# End of indentation here]
It's going to be. And Richards has a lot of ambiguity in the original text. For example, at the beginning of the second sentence, either a need for a liberated intelligence'requires' two things, or a liberated intelligence'requires' those things. It seems to me to say one side, but I decided to use the latter. Therefore, I understood the meaning of'requires' not as a requirement of intelligence when it became free, but as a meaning that refers to what is needed when intelligence is freed. The original text is still mixed enough to allow some other unraveling. For one thing, Mr. Shows the resolving power of Basic, which is similar to such a sentence, and he chose this example. Basic provides us with a choice of unraveling possible meanings, rather than recreating any one meaning. Therefore, it can be said that knowing Basic is one of the effective help for British and Americans to thoroughly understand the meaning of English sentences.

Also, poet and critic William Empson (1906-), who has studied mathematics for a long time, said, "When I was free to use Basic's idioms and their very straightforward grammar, I sometimes had a habit of humor. But it doesn't make people feel uncomfortable .... In the Basic organization, the part that may be more difficult than Ogden thinks about, for example, instead of saying "forget", "from my heart or memory" It's a good discipline of mind, not as a habit of foreign languages, but because you have to use metaphors rationally. Basic is a rational tool. I sometimes go from English to Basic and decide if it's meaningless. "2
2 William Mpson: "Teaching Literature" ("Bungei", February 1945).
Furthermore, it is the close relationship between mathematics and language that Mr. Torahiko Terada insisted. That is, "There is a correlation between the number of students in mathematics and the number of students in language based on the results of the entrance examination (although there are exceptions, of course). I think there is something in common. Language is a tool for talking about us, but it is also a tool for thinking. In mathematics, we first make some affirmative assumptions and then follow logic. We analyze what is included in the premise and assemble what we have analyzed, but the process of carrying thoughts according to our language is also possible. Even when you look at it, it seems that the learning of mathematics and the learning of language have similar points in terms of method. To master the language, first learn the slogan and learn the grammar. However, I have to understand and memorize it all by myself, and I can't write a sentence unless I can speak by myself. It can be used as a tool to carry thoughts. Even in mathematics, if you understand all the things in the textbooks and lecture notes, it will not be useful for you. It is difficult to calculate the essence unless you swallow it thoroughly and memorize various formulas to the extent that you can make it your own. I don't know if it will come out as soon as it can be mistaken, but at least as soon as it approaches it, it may come out to develop our language, or rather the way of thinking. " Although it is said to be 1, it should be considered by those who are involved in language education.

(2) Since the basic vocabulary and the number of idioms obtained by unioning the husband properly are constant from the beginning and the learning goals are displayed at a glance, it is a land that should be traveled. It would be easier to teach professors systematically and systematically from a holistic point of view, as well as to learn the geography of Daegu in advance. Close. As you can see from the fact that up to 600 of the vocabulary 850 are in the form of nouns, Basic is an organization where nouns play an important role. Thus, one important advantage of a linguistic organization that emphasizes nouns is to be able to make great use of professors who rely on 繪 to begin learning rather than concrete ones2. At the same time, the so-called verbs that are considered urgent and unnecessary are eliminated, which greatly reduces the negative effects of memory. Original English is a relatively simple language, but if you first introduce 100 conjugation verbs, it will be difficult to learn. I have to remember at least 200 irregular past and past participle forms in addition to these 100. However, since the 850 words of Basic include all kinds of words in English, it is extremely convenient to give a minimum basic knowledge of English.

(3) In Basic, the same words and phrases always appear repeatedly in the stamen, so the usage is naturally marked on the stamen, and it is necessary without being distracted. It comes out that the words and phrases are in the private basket. In this way, I can manage to express my thoughts and feelings quickly. In other words, soon you will find a part of yourself that you are familiar with, rather than an English-speaking bystander. This is the most important step in learning one language.
In English learning, the need for multi-faceted vocabulary is called out, but for this purpose Basic was devised as an international auxiliary language, unlike other so-called Simplified texts. In addition, since a certain number of common terms that should be used for various scientific, commercial, and other purposes are prepared, it is possible to provide a large number of articles that are simple in vocabulary and advanced in content. Come out. Many such articles 1 have already been published. Therefore, Basic is different from the vocabulary that is useful for writing stories at best. Regarding this, Mr. Rohei Ishiguro expressed his hope from an early stage, saying, "Vocabulary. Even if you look at thousands or millions, it is completely empty unless you really reasonably determine what kind of position you should take. The instrumental statistics of the usage of printed forms, such as popular essays on general subjects, are, after all, meaningless vocabulary tables. This is Edward L. Thorndike's "The Teacher's Word." If you scrutinize the representative research materials of the road, such as "Book", you will find that it is only halfway through the thoughts. Choose a vocabulary, put it into a semantic group, and then calculate its stats. For the first time, I feel relieved. "2

(4) In Basic, one of the major characteristics of the organization is that it eliminates the most difficult and troublesome so-called verbs to learn, and instead gives, get; take, put; come, go; keep, let as "action verbs". Use only the basic verbs make, say, see, send, do, have, be and seem, and use them extensively in the organization, but also combine them with prepositions and adverbs. As already mentioned, making it work as a verb makes Basic a very idiomatic English word. I have heard about this from a well-known senior, and I found it very interesting. It was heard by a famous economist who was fluent in Middle English and a Japanese gentleman talking to an Englishman, but later mentioned, they got, put, have, do and He used on, in, at, etc., but he was amazed that the story would proceed fluently. Therefore, in order to cultivate the true knowledge of English conjugation, it is extremely necessary to become proficient in the conjugation of the basic Anglo-Saxon verbs. I understand that it is difficult to do otherwise, but if you do not understand the familiar things, contradictions often occur * [# 2 character dot, 1-2-22]. Therefore, it may be effective in the end to thoroughly teach the usage of these basic verbs in the early stages of English learning from the perspective of English research. In the out of the East [# "Out of the East" is italicized], "Kyushu Gakusei", the students of Japanese high school are in English. I'm not used to the pure writing style. There is a general tendency to write larger words than smaller ones and write complex sentences that are longer than plain short sentences. Perhaps he also uses relatively difficult books to translate. It is difficult for Japanese students to use the so-called idiomatic English expressions that use simple words. And, after all, it is based on the psychological differences between the East and West peoples. I have to correct this tendency, but sometimes I have to write an interesting story in a single spelling, and on the other hand, because of the nature of the subject, I have to write it in a simple way, for example, " The day I went to school for the first time, "he wrote an essay and was quite successful. I say what it means. I think that it will be a reminder in the professor of conversation and composition.
250 idioms were stipulated in the advanced stages of Basic, and 250 idioms for essays were stipulated in the advanced stages, and Smith (LP Smith) also pointed out by this. In addition, although the use of many verbs can be saved, there are concerns by those who do not understand the Basic organization well that learning these idioms may be difficult for learners. I'm sorry. And they argue that instead of learning the idioms that Basic needs, it's better to learn 200 or 300 new words, and it's more effective. .. At the same time, if we consider this issue more closely, we cannot say that the claim is always correct. In other words, the usage of "action words" and "direction words" in Basic is, after all, necessary for all purposes of learning English, and is also a slogan that will be given later * [# 2 character dot, 1-2-22 ] Advanced usage is also necessary to read and speak at least any English as well as new words. At the same time, it helps to build more certain knowledge about the basic usage of "action words" and "direction words". However, no matter how simple and easy the new words may seem at first glance, for learners, the pronunciation, spelling, irregular inflections, usage, etc. that accompany them are common to teachers. It has a habit of not sticking. Moreover, it is especially important in the case of words that are commonly used in everyday life. (For example, various usages of the verb bear). However, since Basic is a coherent organization, teaching other words to others in the middle of the study will rather obstruct the organization and interfere with the work of the Basic vocabulary. Become. In addition, no matter how many other words are cultivated, no practical effect can be expected until 850 words are fully understood.
Basic idioms emphasized the natural development from the basic word-by-word meanings such as "activities" and "directions" that were already well understood, and this is the meaning. It is the same as the case of the sword. Therefore, the idiotic ones were excluded. Most of the power to organize Basic was thus spent on creating a detailed inventory of these idioms, and the results are contained in The Basic Words [# "The Basic Words" is italicized]. I'm sorry. And since each word that composes these idioms has a clear meaning, the meaning of the table of idioms can be easily understood. That is, the expression is concrete and raw, and it is more impressively marked on the learner's mind than the one that reduces the concept of two or more Latin words into one word. It is very convenient. In general, we teachers usually say that this English language is more difficult to learn than his English language, but the difficulty is how to teach. It must be noted that it depends largely on how to handle the teaching materials. It is completely useless to stuff idioms, collocations, etc. indiscriminately without clearly understanding the meaning of the constituent molecules, as it only increases the negative effects of memory.
(5) Basic English is a limited English in its essence, not a changed English, so when you go beyond Basic and enter ordinary English, you will be hindered or learned by it. Not to mention that there is no need to fix it, the solid basic knowledge gained from Basic is a very good natural step toward ordinary English. Mr. Ogden says about this. "It [#" it "is" it "in the bottom line] If you are a person who has completed the acquisition of Basic, which is a complete organization on your own, and you think that you should gradually supplement that knowledge, Basic The necessary chains are prepared to advance to more ordinary English. That is, 150 words that should come after 850 words (1,000 words in total), 350 words that follow this, 500 words that are further propagated, and 1,000 words, or (including the main points of vocabulary usage) The vocabulary, which has increased to 2,000 words, is selected based on the same principle that 850 words were selected, along with some vocabulary words. Thus, Basic itself always serves as the basis of learning in this case. There is something to be especially careful about. It is clear that most of the 850 words in the table can have usages other than those permitted by Basic as an international auxiliary language. Thus, at some point in ordinary English learning, it is clear that these non-Basic usages will fall into the basic organization. At the same time, at the beginning, you have to keep your hands on the core of Basic. That is, the Basic organization should leave it as it is until the gradually increasing vocabulary provides the similar word forms necessary for understanding derivative words and inflections other than the basic rules. .. If so, it is inevitable to be mixed. Thus, incorporating 50 special verbs at a particularly appropriate time (ie, after mastering all 1,500 words) is not necessary to enter the intended normal English. It is a thing. Therefore, the first vocabulary to be supplemented is the names 150 of animals, plants and foods that are not internationally distributed. Following the addition of words that can be drawn here, the first stage additional vocabulary 350 * (nouns and adjectives) comes, followed by the second and third additional vocabularies. At the same time, the special vocabulary prepared for applying Basic to science, commerce, economics and The Basic Bible [# "The Basic Bible" is italic] is the stage where the additional vocabulary reaches 2,000, that is, the final stage. In, it may be gradually adopted. "1 and.

(6) When dealing with ordinary English teaching materials after steadily mastering the operation of 850 words of Basic, it is always possible to use Basic and systematically implement the Direct method by the English through Basic method. It will appear. In addition, it is possible to compile an annotation with the necessary notes only in Basic. Two types of dictionaries 2 have also been published for these purposes.

In general language learning, it is extremely important to dynamically observe linguistic phenomena and to pursue them organically, that is, to cultivate the habit of treating them as living things. The effectiveness of the study is not due to the number of words memorized as monolingual words, especially in the case of vocabulary used, but to the sufficient understanding and operation of the basic words selected even in small numbers. You must always enlighten the learner. We always witness that the final win in a kendo match is determined by the very few skills that we are most good at. Inflation of non-policy idioms in the early stages of learning should be warned. Also, in Basic, the diction law is also restricted, and it is intended to be simple and straightforward. For example, the subordinating pronouns use only who and which, and instead of using'as' meaning "so" and "kara", they use'because'. Also, take the form of'It is better for you to go.'Rather than the form of'You had better go.'. Model sentence patterns that indicate the sequence order of words include'We will give simple rules to you now.' And'The camera-man who made an attempt to take a moving picture of the society women, before they got their hats off, did. Not get off the ship till he was questioned by the police.'
(7) Basic is used as the first step of learning English when you bend down and practice swimming in the pool before you go out to the river. Thus, in Basic, there are restrictions on how to express a certain meaning, so it may seem cramped to those who have already learned English, and the expression may seem to be dull, but beginners. Since the wording is regular and there is a place to go, the ki will not be distracted, and the arrangement will always appear in the formula of the ideological table, and the learning will be carried out effectively. Also, if an ordinary person who has already learned English knows Basic and applies it to everyday conversations, essays, letters, etc., he will not be confused by the choice of words and will make unsightly mistakes. It is extremely convenient for me to be able to make it in time for urgent use without having to do it.
According to Mr. Richards's professor Minachi in China, he was able to teach 500 of the Basic vocabulary first in the first grade, and to acquire accurate basic knowledge of English in two years. It is said that the result is much better than that of the method of arriving. * In Japan as well, I think it is time to defeat the value of Basic by debate rather than discussion.
* I.A. Richards: "Basic English and its Applications." (Journal of the Royal Society of Arts [# "Journal of the Royal Society of Arts" is italicized], June, 1939.) P. 745.
Of course, it is the most important thing for an English professor at a secondary school in Japan to ensure its accuracy and perfection. At the same time, being trapped in the Correct English slogan may not result in hindering ephemeral progress. As Professor G.P. Krapp said, I think we should allow a little intelligibility now. It is easy to forget the purpose of the person who respects the tools too much. Some people say that the culture of China did not grow in the wake of the Chinese people who carefully nurtured the Chinese characters. It is the responsibility of progressive educators to recognize the strengths of the organization and apply it to the professor, rather than discussing only its weaknesses to the new teaching method. .. Innovation always begins with a principled purification. Students must be rescued from overkill. Passion is born and overflows in the place where the innocence controls.
