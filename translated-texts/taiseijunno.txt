When the Kenseito party organized the cabinet on behalf of Mr. Ito, even those who frequently opposed and made noise know themselves. However, I was laughing by myself, thinking that it was a very difficult discussion. At the time of the renewal, Satsuma, Choshu, and Doshu took power, and Enomoto and Otori were angry at what they were able to do with their skills. Those who were hungry and chilled. How about the place, after a while, I think I started with myself and became a companion to Satsumacho. There are a lot of things. At the same time, the new Cabinet is no longer getting a bad reputation / \, but in that case, the inner circle will be distorted and it will not continue for a long time. As a whole, the properties of Okuma, who is the general of the liver and kidney, and Itagaki are completely different. Itagaki is such a person, and Okuma is a person who is astute, and whether he can be friends with him all the time, he is always in a fight sooner or later. Whether it's Okuma or Itagaki, when I was in the private sector, I thought that I would be able to get rid of people when I came out, but now I'm handed over and see. Surprisingly, wholesalers do not wholesale. With the so-called Okame Hachime, you can criticize the moves of others, but when you hit them yourself, you can't go as if you were looking at them by your side.
