-------------------------------------------------- -----

One of the origins of this language is the grass of Emura scholars. I believe that it is not always necessary to add 12 thoughts when recording this in Mannensho. The scholar is a small 兒 * [# "mouth + doo", 26-3] voice [# "* [#" mouth + doo ", 26-3] voice" with a white circle emphasis mark] Going forward, it is said that it will become the raw material of the language [# the white circle emphasis mark on the "raw material of the language"]. It is a problem that is not easy in linguistics. Therefore, the prediction is so-called humble. For the convenience of this research, Ichio He * [# "Mouth + Doo", 26-5] The voice and the raw material of the language should be separated or given a good reason. Therefore, the term follows MUELLER, and * [# "mouth + doo", 26-6] is an onomatopoeia [# "intermittent" with a white circle side point]. To name the problem of INTERJECTIONAL, and to name a part of the so-called raw material of the language (half of the example) as the problem of the original word (ONOMATOPOETISCH). With young people. The word "ONOMATOPOEIE" has the significance of the Greeks and the scholars often use other words instead of the ones that are prone to misunderstandings and misunderstandings. Or, it's called IMSONISCH, IMITATIO + SONUS, or PATHOGNOMISCH, and MUELLER first named WAU-WAU-THEORIE, and thus PAH-PAH -Theorie sneaks into a person's demeanor and makes it difficult to insult a scholar, and withdraws Gono. In short, I'm not young enough to understand the word of the voice. I will not outline the problem of the interim word source. * [# "Mouth + Doo", 26-11] SCHREI is a very effective word. HERDER is hard to come by. * [# "Mouth + Doo", 26-11] No matter what the voice changes to, there is no language at the end. Separately, when you get a sound [# "white circle emphasis mark on" sound "] (TON) and call it a sign (MERKMAL), you start to make a language. JACOB GRIMM also says. * [# "Mouth + Doo", 26-14] When the voice makes a moaning cry (WIMMERN, WEINEN), it does not make a language at the end. Being a person who can get a good deal (ERWORBEN) separately from the language. LAZAR GEIGER's theory is based on the word 獸 * [# "mouth + doo", 27-1] [# "獸 * [#" mouth + doo ", 27-1]" with a white circle side point] (TIERSCHREI). * [# "Mouth + Doo", 27-1] [# "Word * [#" Mouth + Doo ", 27-1]" with a white circle side point] (SPRACHSCHREI) Or, the one that causes greed is called 獸 * [# "mouth + doo", 27-2], and the word that makes the original word by looking at things, looking at movements during the period, and making a voice. * [# "Mouth + Doo", 27-3], and the word * [# "Mouth + Doo", 27-3] is said to sometimes occur in the voice and the club.餘 abbreviates. The so-called crying voice of a scholar * [# "Mouth + Doo", 27-4] Contrary to this, the sound of his a, u and the combined sound of b, p, m, d, etc. are ordinary * [# "mouth + doo", 27-4]. It's the sound of a place where you can quickly squeeze. If you order the name of the voice * [# "mouth + doo", 27-5], or the so-called word * [# "mouth + doo", 27-5] If not possible. The origin of these sounds, especially papa, mama, is to be approved by the families, and in the WUNDT book, the sounds of the parents and their sons are used. The word "rejecting oneself" can be used as a footnote to the theory of scholars. Next, let's move on to the question of the original word. When you call it a cloud, it resembles something that consciously imitates the sound. In the olden days, TIEDEMANN thought that it was possible to create a slogan with a language, and imitated the sound (SCHALLNACHAHMUNG). Many later scholars are vulnerable. The original voice is unintentional. STEINTHAL's theory of 蹪 聲 is that 蹪 聲 does not only imitate the sound, but also the emotion of the sound [# "emotion" with a white circle emphasis mark]. When you enter the category of voice, you will be struck. Don't worry about it. MUELLER is easy to come by. There are not many words in the voice. According to the law of speech movement [# "white circle emphasis mark on" speech movement "] (LAUTVERSCHIEBUNG) * [#" tehen + 僉 ", 3rd level 1-84-94] I know that most of the things that I have to do are not in the voice. In the meantime, something that should be clearly recognized as a voice is also effective in forming derivative words. In addition to excluding the words of parents' food in the examples of scholars' words, there are some problems with human voice. In particular, the various words of the chicken are detailed in the book of MUELLER. However, KUCKUCK is CUCULUS CANORUS L. and is different from the chicken GALLUS DOMESTICUS BRISS. The names of these two birds are ordinary voices. Like the left.

The last thing to note is that it is necessary to consider the similar and heterogeneous of various languages due to the fact that the word is pierced. The so-called Indianic-Germanic, Japanese, and Chinese languages are usually considered to be heterogeneous, and the fact that the heterogeneous languages have common root elements is a little approving of the Germanic scholars.
