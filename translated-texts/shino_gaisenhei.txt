Cannon bullets in the rain
I was always drawing
Nostalgic hometown
It was a stop

Wrapped in white cloth
In a wooden box
The silent hero
Embraced in my hometown
To be happy
Shake
There will be

Lightly
Humble
Dedicated a wooden box
Comrades
A faint smell of cannon smoke
While feeling
Growing up
    feelings
I was holding back

The mourning flag is quiet
Dripping
Like hitting water
In the welcome
Now sad death
The triumphant return soldier
Go
