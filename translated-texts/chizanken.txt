T bought bamboo and * [# "bamboo kanmuri / tampering", 3rd level 1-89-64] for me, and he recommended me to practice making it easier for me. It was a very old story. It's a strange word to say that it's easy to practice tea and flowers, but at the beginning I really enthusiastically continued the practice. I didn't know anything about the theory of I Ching, and I managed to do it enthusiastically while being taught, without any prior knowledge such as the inside | hoe somehow outside | hoe.
From before that, when I believed in I Ching, I visited Mr. K's house in Omori and asked for fortune-telling, so fire [# "emphasis mark"] or water [# "water" "Emphasis mark", heaven [# "emphasis mark" on "heaven"], earth [# "emphasis mark" on "earth"], wind [# "emphasis mark" on "wind"], and thunder [# "emphasis mark" on "thunder"] Both the "emphasis mark on the swamp" and the mountain [# the emphasis mark on the "mountain"] managed to know only the shape of the sauifu elephant. It was very difficult to move the sword, and while being taught by a person, I squeezed three small ten-sen silver coins to distinguish between the shade and the sun on the back and front, and put six silver coins on the floor. The elephant "shape" was shown as it appeared. This was much easier.
If I have a personal consultation about myself or if someone else is at a loss, I may ask the teacher about it, and even if I look at the dizzying method, it is mysteriously correct. I got the answer. At one point, it also came up with an answer that was difficult to interpret. At one point, I thought about asking about my lifelong hexagram, but I was curious about the answer. From a young age to middle age, my job was mainly to fight illness (not my own illness, but a good man's father's illness, a good man's long illness, a sister-in-law's long illness, a brother-in-law's illness, and Tomonafu's financial efforts, as if I had come to my wife to work as a nurse, I took pride in it and worked in that direction for almost the rest of my life.) Maybe I When I was wondering if a "sister-in-law" would appear in my life, the answer was surprisingly "Ken Chizanken". I was mostly surprised and felt as if I had been hit in the head.
[# Indent two characters from here]
"Ken is Toho. The end of the prince is Ariyoshi. ○ According to the story, Tendou is down and bright. Healed and ascended. Tendou came to Mitsuru and humbly benefited, and the steady flow changed and humbly flowed, and the demon god was evil. Humbly fortune, humanitarianism is bad for humor, and he likes humility. Humility is precious and shining, and healed and unyielding. The end of the prince. "
[# End of indentation here]
Humility is humility, humility, and humbleness. The high mountain of Hazu's gèn is under the land of the gon, which should be low. Maybe I have to stay under the folds of my life. "Humble labor, end of Kimiko Ariyoshi" is the word of Ken Chiyama's chief "Yukau". He interpreted that he would work with humility for the rest of his life without raising his head, and die safely and peacefully. Above all, the word "end is good" gives us bright hope. When I'm in trouble, when I'm at a loss, I always mutter like a talisman, Ken is a talisman, and when I'm afraid, a great deal of courage comes out and the tunnel road Even in the dark, you can work steadily and steadily. I think this belief is not a superstition, but rather a common sense, but it is a pity that humans who have dreamed of life since my dawn can remember this mediocre lesson for a day. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, only this "Ken Jiyama" has no evil in any of the swords, and instead, every sword has a promise to keep humility and wait for the end. .. That solid and sober promise is also a lifelong salvation for me, who is not so solid. For me there is no heaven [# "emphasis mark"], no fire [# "emphasis mark"], no wind [# "emphasis mark"]. Let's be satisfied with that.
