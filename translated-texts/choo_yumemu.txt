[# 2 indentation] At the beginning of the poetry collection [# "At the beginning of the poetry collection" is the middle heading]

This collection of poems contains 60 poems. Except for the 16th edition, this is the first new edition of a poetry book that is not in the published poetry collection.
This collection of poems is divided into two parts, the first part and the second part. The first part should be regarded as a collection of selected poems from the second poetry collection "Aoneko", and the second part should be regarded as a collection of the first poetry collection "Barking at the Moon". That is, the first part is relatively new, and the second part is the most popular work.
In short, this poetry collection is my collection of poems [# "Shiromaru emphasis mark" in "Collection of poems"]. However, that does not necessarily mean the conscience or inferiority of the content. "Selected" in the published poetry collection is rather due to other causes-inconsistency with other poetry styles, similarities of consensus and duplication, and especially when compiling the poetry. The poetry that was lost. In fact, the four episodes such as "Dream a butterfly", "Armed 臺", "Gray road", and "The neckline is a fish" are mistaken to be included in "Blue cat". It was drafted. (I would be very happy if there was a loyal spectator who would cut these episodes and put them in a part of the "blue cat".) Yes, I have some doubts. It's not that there is a mixture of unsolved studies, which I feel. Rather, Sauifu wants to leave it to the appreciation of the general public.
The inscription of the poetry collection is "dreaming of butterflies". It was taken from a poem of the same title on the head.

[# 1 indentation] Dreaming of butterflies [# "Dreaming of butterflies" is the middle heading]

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
Spread the big, hot wings in the tatami room
Butterfly's Chihisa ugly face and its long tentacles
With the weight of the hot and fluffy paper that spreads out on paper.
I wake up in the white floor.
I try to trace the memory of my dreams
Dreams are lonely autumn evening stories
With the setting sun on the banks of the water
A wonderful story about an old vacant house that is constantly rotting.

While dreaming, I cried like a child
The soul of a childish child without news
In the grass growing in the garden of an empty house, I cried as soon as I was sick.
The emotions of a childish child
I was wondering if I could kill the faint light of Tohoi Mizube.
Ahida for a long time I dreamed and cried.

In a new tatami room, butterflies spread their wings.
Shake the white, hot, paper-like wings.

[# 1 indentation] Armed 寢臺 [# "Armed 寢臺" is the middle heading]

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
One 询 臺 decorated with beautiful aralia cordata
Warm and warm
Ah, I longed for it, and every time I longed for it, I even dreamed of it.
The only one I was looking for
When you lie on this 臺 臺, it is warm and warm
This 寢 臺 holds me with two arms
There are fun words of love
On that big chest with the joy of every life
I throw a tired body
Oh, what is the joy of being on this 臺 for the first time?
That joy is a secret joy that no one knows
It is the joy of life that spreads with great power.
Miyo: One soul doesn't slurp on it
One soul is on top of it
Where is the great mercy like that?
It comforts those who praise it, and warms what they seek.
Everyone's heart sleeps comfortably in the child's way
Ah, this one 寢 臺, one 寢 臺 that I dream of
Oh, where is the ghost of this illusion?

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
He is hungry for emotions.
He's like a boat sailing in the wind
Don't chase him
Don't be fooled by him
Run him up to the distant white splash of water.
Ah, there is health in the place where he goes.
There is a big white bed of happiness.
When you live away from me
What annoyance he has!
I'll stop here with me
Let's go out to the beach and pick up shellfish
Let's take a look at the trunk of the pine tree
Now when I sit in the gray dunes
I can tear my little happiness.
Oh, do him and put him on the white sea far off the coast.
He has his happiness.
Oh, so one bird flies into the blue sky.

[# 1 indentation] Do not feel the light of the winter sea [# "Do not feel the light of the winter sea" is the middle heading]

It's a day when you can see the light of the winter sea in the distance
The sound of the lonely Onami "Ohonami" makes my heart relax.
Will the boats passing by Naruto off the coast of Kefu hang down?
The black arms of the benefactors, etc.

Watch the splash of freezing waves alone
View the treetops of pine trees growing in the sandy shores
To the emotions of the bugs that crawl in the sun here
It's a lonely day when I crawl in the shadow of a sandy mountain in search of that
It's a day when you can see the light of the winter sea in the distance
Oh my melancholy day
Listen to that loud roaring sound
Once in the flow of that big wave
Ring the lonely nostalgic sterling silver bell
My hurting flesh and heart.


[# 1 indentation] Harassment [# "Harassment" is a middle heading]

Flapping the heavy and big wings "Tsubasa"
Oh, I ’m the owner of a weak heart.
On a bright moonlit night with natural gas
Look at the group of creatures that are flowing white

In the bright moonlit night of natural gas
Ah, it's a sad butterflies harassment.


[# 1 indentation] Walk in search of the crowd [# "Walk in the crowd" is the middle heading]

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
I always seek the city
Seeking to be in a busy crowd of the city.
The crowd is a wandering thing with great emotions
It's a guruupu [# "guruupu" with an emphasis mark] with a single will and love that flows everywhere.
Ah, the twilight of spring without things
Seeking a shadow between the crowded architecture of the city and the architecture
How happy it is to be caught in a large crowd
Miyo: The flow of this crowd
One wave is on top of one wave
Nami creates an endless shade. The shade spreads loosely.
The sadness and sorrow of each person disappears in the shadow of that place.
Ah, with a soft heart, I will walk along this road as well.
Ah, this great love and innocent fun shadow
The feeling of being taken by the other side of the fun wandering becomes tearful.
The twilight of an enviable spring day
This group of people swims in the eaves of architecture and architecture
Where and why
One big shadow on the ground that envelops my melancholy
Just a flow of innocent waves
Ah, forever, forever, I want to be caught in the waves of this crowd.

[# 1 indentation] Moon shadow inside [# "Moon shadow inside" is a middle heading]

The shadow of melancholy
Inside this dark house

Secretly go through the wall
Is it the one that can be seen on the keyboard of the hand-held organ?
Religion over there
The quiet feelings overflow in the room.

Turn off the Western light "Rampu"
Turn off the Western light "Rampu"
Inside a dark and melancholy room
Let's see the flow of meditation.
Take the book and put it on the shelf
Protect yourself from the overflowing emotional floods.
Turn off the Western lights
Turn off the Western lights.

Now the melancholy is heavy
The shadow of the black sword
Wander lonely without sound
What is one ghostly illusion?
The sound of the slippage is also gentle
Is there a shadow on Koyohi here?
Oh, the moon shadow that goes inside
Flow on the stairs.


[# 1 indentation] Overpass [# "Overpass" is the middle heading]

Let's cross the overpass

[# 1 indentation] Gray road [# "Gray road" is the middle heading]

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
A road to take a walk at nightfall
Alone my drool
A lonely road under the gray sky
Aware, a maiden in a dream these days
I'm in love with the maiden
The maiden wears a long pale yellow shoulder strap
The shoulders and the like are sled and look pitiful
Oh under this lonely gray sky
Our heart speaks in a straightforward manner. Wet with the dew on the grass and hang out.
Fat
Do you hear the thunder in that distant sky?
Mafuka listens to the sound of the waves fluttering in the sky.

Fat
Standing on the road on this dark winter day
I can smell the chrysanthemum in my hands
I feel sick and depressed.
It ’s my past that makes me miserable
It ’s the shadow of a long-standing loneliness.
Now this is a tree [# "There is a tree" in the bottom is "a row of trees"] Beyond the streets on a winter day
I look at the graveyard of a distant white day
Only the faint name of last night's dream
Look at the edge of the lonely Ariake mountain.
I'm a kid. I'm a kid.

Fat
A maiden in a dream without words
Always the Two of Us
Feeling the mysterious musk to Oma
Let's go to the tomb in the foggy valley.

[# 1 indentation] The hand is a candy [# "The hand is a candy" is a middle heading]

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
How about a sloppy work that seems to be true?
How about the swelling of sweets as a whole?
The fingers are really slender and supple
It's like a small blue fish
I'm dying to move gently and gently
Oh i want to kiss on that hand
I want to eat it by putting it on my mouth
What a fluffy fingertip that is rounded
How about the taste of this mysterious flower that blooms in the valley between fingers?
The scent is musk and looks like a lightly sweaty peach blossom.
The finger of a woman who has just finished working on Rei
Smooth pine white fingers
Finger hitting the keyboard of Pia's [# "Emphasis mark on Pia"]
A finger of work that holds a needle and removes silk
While flirting with the shoulders seeking love
On the skin that is easy to feel
Lightly touch your toes
Scratch with light nails
The function of the finger to push it lightly and firmly
The joy of love that makes you flutter and miburuhi
A finger that tickles violently and cunningly
Recommended and wicked index finger
Cowardly and cheerful little finger mischief
The fat beauty of the thumb and its violent savagery.
Ah, please touch the smooth and polished finger of the tights
I want to keep it in my mouth and keep it in my mouth.
The back of the hand is the bulge of Watupuru [# "Emphasis mark"]
The fingers of that hand are the appetite of rock candy
Oh, this appetite
A child's nasty and ignorant appetite.

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
The fish that rises from the fluffy valley
Always moist and pale long neckline
Smoothly polished marble pillars
Immediately and white
So shy neckline
The sloppy curve of this sloppy neck
Nice architecture that is always painted with face powder
The sticky feeling of the fish that sticks to the skin
Also, how is it good in the half-collar of the fish?
Ah, the mysterious temptation of this sleek straight line
I can't help the sound of the wet fish
No one to squeeze the algae
I want to quickly stick to this strange pillar of architecture
Fast, fast, leave yourself to this unsolvable dream Nymph.

[# 1 indentation] Spring sprout [# "Spring sprout" is the middle heading]

I said goodbye to my corroded body
And from the newly created torso
New limb buds grew
They are really vaginal
It ’s the children of Gura ’s sprout that may or may not be there.
It will be such a beautiful spring day
It screams in my body
The buds of adorable limbs
Say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
It ’s my sweet sprout.
It's a cell that can be torn off
Say goodbye to the past
It will be a lot of fun
On the glittering lawn of the sun
On new human skin
It's time to dance the spring polka.


[# 1 indentation] Black bat [# "Black bat" is the middle heading]

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
My melancholy is flapping
It flies around the room flutteringly.
Oh what a hallucination
The rambling and lazy weather sheds lonely tears.
The ship of recollection has already gone down the harbor
The curly hair of the gentle lover has dried even more.
The beard of the kelp insects in the grass field
The season is just too white for the dead.
Oh I don't see anything.
At least one of my daughters
Sing a gentle song of the evening breeze from the hazy sky of the graveyard.

A phantom corpse sleeps behind a green stone bamboo flower
The black skull is on the floor
The limbs are thrown out without force, and they flutter on the 询 臺.
Behind the curtain of this closed room
A pale mysterious lust that secretly disappears without sound
Sohamushika Hesu Musk
It's crazy, it's hard, and it's just as good as it gets.
Oh, now I'm close to the light of the spring night
I'm glad to play with the body of Adipocere
Apply oil to the gentle chibi and play with the smooth white limbs.
That is one lonely blue cat
You, I'm scared of the Incubus.
[# End of indentation here]


[# 1 indentation] Seabird [# "Seabird" is the middle heading]

One night in the distant sky
The light of the Western lantern
Going around the dry place of the house
Or wander around the beach
I'm listening to the sound of the night waves.

Wet in the rain
The lonely heart opened my mouth
Where did that seabird go?
Flying through the dark moonlit night of fate
I cry when I peck at the carrion that has become dirty in the night
Oh, it flew far away and didn't go away.

Sausa Utaru Plateau
Friend, let's stand at this height and take a look.
To think about our life
I've already suffered from the anguish of rut
There is exhilarating nature here
The wind blows through the panoramic view.
If you open your eyes
The eyes get wet with the feeling of recollection.
Come here, my friend
Plateau plants grow here
The idea of comfort in the sun warms up.
Oh you
It's been a long time since I've had a bad feeling.


[# 1 indentation] Toad [# "Toad" is a middle heading]

Sit in the shadow of a bright folding screen
Listen to your gentle breath.
The fragrant smoke
There is a sword
I feel the gentle scent of women.

Kami's hair long beside you
Listen to the words of sleep
You fall asleep
I think of your dreams
This mysterious emotion
Where is the shadowless fantasy going?

The faint white sea urchin of twilight
Looking at the far ghostly lake water
Follow the lonely foothills all the way
On the mountain pass of the unseen distant view
You are alone on the road Mayofu on the road.

Oh, what are you longing for?
Do you want to go to Izuko
Are you going to go to Izuko, Izuko?
Vinegar your sentiment to Incubus
Sea urchin with white chrysanthemum flowers
A faint sacred mystery.

[# With line break from here, wrap and indent one character]
I want to squeeze the tide
The shellfish's teeth melted in the vinegar.
Oh, there are no friends or friends here anymore
Wet in the beach and look at the dead grass
The grass roots are white and hazy in the smoke
It's the sigh of the lukewarm lovers of spring night.
From the dimly visible offshore
The boats sing a mysterious voyage song, and the time signature is high and the sound of 楫 can be heard.
The rocky shore here is suspiciously uneven
Muramura Tozu rises high and crawls in the shadows
It's a ghost of a lonely parasitic crab, a hermit crab.

[# 1 indentation] Wild mouse [# "No mouse" is a middle heading]

Where is our happiness?
The more you dig the sand of the mud
Isn't sadness finally springing up?
In spring, as a sway behind the curtain
I went while being shaken by a rickshaw in the distance.
Where are our lovers?
Even if you stand in a rugged field and whistle
The fantasy daughters will never come.
Put on the dirt mark of Namida [# "Emphasis mark"]
I walk like Hiyotori
Oh no more hope, no honor, no future
Only irreplaceable regrets
I ran to the wild mouse.

Walking in the pine forest
I saw a coffee shop "Kafue"
Far away from the city
No one is visiting
Matsuma's hidden coffee shop "Kafue" in a dream.
Tome includes the sword of 戀戀
A mechanism to bring a separately made plate that is refreshing to Akebono

I was able to eat omelettes
White clouds in the sky
It is a very quiet diet.

In the carriage
I fell asleep comfortably.
Pretty lady
Don't wake me up
The streets of bright street lights
Passing the countryside of the wonderful greenery

I chase after humming
Pretty lady
Until you come to the flower-shaped eaves of the inn
Don't wake me up.

We are a fugitive of despair
We're in prison
Hit that gloomy fence

The guard was flirting with the leaves of the tree.

From that point on
We fled and came
Under the cold sky in that distant aurora region
Everyone is a squirrel crawling * [# "廴 + 囘", 4th level 2-12-11]
Wherever we go
There was a dark, cloudy, barking weather.

On the banks of the escape road
We saw various nature
Barracks, the sea, lakes, mountains, cities, villages, factories, military camps, hospitals, copper mines, etc.
We run away
I saw unsightly nature everywhere
I came across damnly everywhere.

We run away
Anyway, it ’s the prison
The rules are lazy to capture us
We are honest and unreliable
I don't believe in gods, what do I believe in?
Conscience is right
We are desperate fugitives.

Run away
Run away
From that desolate region
From the city
From the factory
From life
Escape from fate
Sauda! It's an escape from fate.

The sun is about to set
The cordon was stretched
We are powerless rebels
I just know the blasphemy of the misanthropy, the obscene, the void.
Oh no way out
We are desperate fugitives.

With a stubborn gaze
Of course, he was invincible
"The guys who are fast children!"
So, the minions rushed and squeezed Ki in all directions.
I was proud of my job.

Explode into the White House
I kidnapped a passing lady on the street
Their business is a miracle
It looks as if it is suitable for etiquette.
Shizuka, lightning, eradicating, it's like a dream
Cars in the city
I don't find any peace.
Of course, the invincible and daring guys
From a seamless plan
From bravery, from cheerfulness, from lust that can't be pushed
It's a bird that freely cuts through the sky.
Look, look, where the attack is
Illuminated by will and reason
The secret of the yakuza is stripped
Idols are beaten everywhere. [# "I'm beaten." Is "beaten" in the bottom line]

With the stubborn eyes of Gang Yi "Hitomi"
Our boss will join forces.
We are cowardly, shabby, and unreliable gangsters who are not worth living.
When you believe in our boss
Our lives are engorged
Even those who have been offering their friends
When Ponbutsukomi
Immediately slam into the shrine of the quarrel, the rope, and the enemy "Kataki".

Our boss is a free person
It's a hawk that goes through the blue sky.
Of course, he ’s a fearless guy.
Plan, carry out, speak, think, and create.
He creates life.

Nirvana glares at the dawn of fever
The pale moonlight
Melancholy Melancholy
Too depressing misanthropic thought
Negative, desperate, lonely tree shadow
It is a flower that moves between the clouds of sorrow.

Nirvana opens at the dawn of the heat
Is it a huge beautiful lotus flower?
Is it a mysterious illusion or heat?
I'm afraid of religious secrecy
One of those gods, Imee [# "Imee" is an emphasis mark] -The temptation to "beautiful death".

Nirvana is also a dream of an aphrodisiac
Mysterious lustful agony
The emotions of those mellow salvation

One strange Imee [# side point to "Imee"] is

The flag of commerce flutters in the land of the earth
It is blown everywhere in the territory of freedom.
Merchant
Your luggage is loaded in the harbor
Now fate honked the sailing whistle.
Shipper
Pilot guide "Pairotsuto"
Why don't you see the clouds rising when you swell in the middle of a terrible storm?
Would you like to see that madness of the demon?

Salmon with a whistle
Now I see a blue dead fish that floats on the side of the ship.
Ah, the day is Yuki Shizumi
Wandering offshore, the ominous seagull sings what.
Merchant
Return to the harbor with palm leaves
Stack your new cotton and agate
Wandering to the mysterious harbors of Asia

Point to the dying frog on the shore.

Famine is approaching the countryside. The rough walls of the farmhouse in winter have frozen.
Now, in the shadow of the faint dark lamp of the Western lamp "Lamp"
The dead spirits of our ancestors are screaming.

Those possessed by the horror of mysterious fate

In the poor countryside of the cold winter
A stupid farmer of sea cows.

Let's hang around the beggars
At the wharf of some distant port
Let's look at the seagrass burning sky
Oh, without a ghostly maiden
I've become the fate of a lonely bouquet
Covered in sand
Let's cry with a grinning sound of the gravel food.

The poems collected in this chapter are from the same period as the works such as "Heavenly Hanging" and "Bamboo and Sorrow" in the first half of "Howling at the Moon", and are very early in my poetry style. All should be seen as a pre-Raphaelite tendency to "bark at the moon." However, the eight volumes were reprinted from the same poetry collection.

The vinegared chrysanthemum is irritating.

If it's a good dusk
As a worker, the whole city of Tokyo becomes a full member
The shadow of those angry hats
Spread in the middle of the city

It's a silver paper of soot-guro snuff
It weighs about 5 momme

It will reach all over the city.
Behind the noisy dusk
The fluttering heart shines [# "emphasis mark"].

From my long history
They are

At that time, their eyes
That I was poking in my hand
On my torso
Those who set up peeping glasses
Hit me

It's a horse-riding horse.

And gradually
I traveled around Tenji
It ’s a strange story
I was a bachelor, a bachelor.

Shizuka Shizuka Let's hug each other together.
Be far from my mother, father and siblings
The heart of orphans that neither my mother nor my father knows
In every human life
Let's talk to you about my own life
About the secret life of only two people
Ah, the words are scattered on my lap as if they were deciduous in autumn.

My chest is a cute little sick child's chest
My heart burns with the sweltering passion of fear.

Oh always I climbed to the top of a high mountain
I longed for the bugs and climbed up the steep slope.
When I stood at the top of the mountain, the bugs wept lonely.
A large white cloud ran down the mountaintop of the fluffy grass.

Nature makes me suffer everywhere
And humanity makes me gloomy
Rather, I walked through the busy city park
I like to find a lonely wooden chair.
I like to look at the sky with a vague heart
Ah, the soot that runs sadly in the sky of the city
I also like to see swallows flying far beyond the roof of the city.

My lonely personality
Call a stranger with a loud voice
My subservient and mysterious personality
Doing a shabby crow
I'm sitting in a corner of a deserted winter chair.

Oh, what a crazy man
In the field of early summer
In a glittering grove
I put a sky blue handbag on my hand
I put a boil on my waist and something like [# "Emphasis mark"]

It shines in the air.

Sitting on the pale beach
You take a sigh of breath.

This pale dog has his forefoot and is keen to dig into the hard ground.
By sensitizing tremors in the distant, distant, underground world.
The barking dog is sorrowful, mad, and digging for what he clearly sees, eager to the graveyard of the moonlit night.

The barking dog is a person [# an emphasis on "person"].
What a loyal, sensitive, but lonely dog.
Until you bark and are shot with a gun for your sick neighbor.
The barking dog is a person [# aside from "person"] on a pale moonlit night.
