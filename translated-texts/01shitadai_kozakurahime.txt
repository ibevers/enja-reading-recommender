This story is, so to speak, one of the spiritual communication conducted at home, and there is no slight exaggeration or impurities. However, due to its nature, as mentioned above, the younger brother also took a very cautious attitude when trying to announce it. After confirming that the shrine is not fictitious, such as by actually investigating the location of the shrine and its training ground, it is the first time that the shrine is published in a magazine.
The spirit world communication can only be credible by the sacrificial act of the innocent mediator, and it seems that there is no great relationship between whether the mediator is homely or not. is there. No, I think that the homely ones should rather be able to complete the composition without worrying about the contamination of impurities.
It must be a product that the younger brother can send with all his heart, regardless of the value of the content. Now that the book is bound, it is important to note a part of its origin when presenting it as a memorial.
