It was one morning. When Mr. Earcho was running alone, a duck came to his side. Very sly, small, pure white duck. And to tell Mr. Earcho
"I know a very interesting play."
Therefore, Mr. Earcho had a habit of wanting to know anything, even though he was weak, so he immediately spoke with his eyes rounded.
"What? Interesting play?"
"It's a button play," said Ahiru-san.
"I don't know about button play. Go to teaching," said Mr. Ahiru.
"It's very easy, and the one who wins gets the button," Ahiru told the ear length about the button play. Mr. Earcho felt like he could win soon. And I wondered how happy my mom would be if I had a lot of winning buttons.
When Mr. Earcho asked, "How many buttons should I bring from my house?", Mr. Ahiru asked.
He said, "I didn't get it from my house, Hora, isn't it here?" And tore off the button about Mr. Earcho's clothes. Mr. Mimicho was overjoyed, thinking that it was time to think about it, and played with it, but he lost. Mr. Earcho was disappointed.
"This time, Kitsuto will win," said Ahiru, and Ms. Earcho was interested in it again and tore off the button. And I lost one button about the kimono.
Mr. Ahiru put the winning button in a rough pocket and said "Goodbye, bye." And flew away.
When I returned to my house, Mr. Earcho was scolded by my mother.
"Good night to go to Bed soon. My mom will put a button on it. Why are you stupid. Tomorrow, I have to talk to my school teacher."
The ear length is worried and irresistible. My mom says she's going to school tomorrow. I was sad and crying. Hearing that voice, a sly duck looked in from the outside of the window and gave a sneak peek. Mr. Earcho decided to dig into the bed and be full of tears.
"Now, that boring thing is over."
After that, Mr. Earcho never became a partner even if he encountered a duck.
