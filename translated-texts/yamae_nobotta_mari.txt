Shiro is now in the first grade. I still can't remember the way to school, so the maid will take me. The maid carried Shiro's younger sister on her back. My sister has a beautiful Mari. The ball was bought by my sister from Tokyo as a souvenir. A picture of a mountain with peach blossoms is drawn on the æ¯¬.
Well, one day, the teacher said, "Let's climb the mountain today." Everyone left the school gate with joy and joy. The mountain was right next to the school so I could climb it right away. I played around in the meadow. The peach blossoms were in bloom. Shiro and his sister all played around there. After a while, I went down the mountain. Shiro was taken home by the maid.
When I came back and noticed, my sister's ball was gone. I haven't wondered what happened or where I went. Since he was taken to the mountain, he suddenly got well and bounced around without permission, and he fell down and said, "This mountain is similar to my painting." Did I fall asleep?
