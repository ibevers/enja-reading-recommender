I heard that a foodie is a big eater. I used to be a big eater, though not now. At that time, I just thought I was a very foodie. Tell my friend Kazuo Dan, etc. that a foodie is a big eater with a serious look, and say oden, ganmodoki, radish, and tofu. When I ate endlessly in such an order, Dan shook his eyes and admired that you were not a foodie. I also taught Uhei Ima the definition of a foodie, but Ima said that he was full of joy and that I might be a foodie. I ate and drank with Ima five or six times, but he was an unmistakable foodie.
If you could eat a lot of cheap and delicious food, it would be better than this. It's a matter of course. That is, it is the mystery of foodie.
One day, at Shimbashi's oden, a young man dexterously peeled off the shrimp roasted oni with chopsticks, and was praised by his girlfriend. Once again, I peeled it off, but it wasn't really good. It looked very stupid. Isn't it okay to peel it off by hand? In Rossiya, even rice curry is eaten by hand.
