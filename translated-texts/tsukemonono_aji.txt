I didn't know the taste of pickles for a long time. Nowadays, the pickles are delicious and tasty.
The salted Chinese cabbage, which can be called the freshness itself, is nice, but the miso pickled radish like tortoiseshell is not good either. The flavor of spicy greens, the color of eggplant, the cheerfulness of cucumber, the grace of thread greens-but I prefer lightly pickled light white to rich kasuzuke.
A good wife keeps delicious pickles on the host's table. I'll affirm that she's a bad wife who feeds on bad pickles!
No matter what kind of treats you have, the last one must be a dish of delicious pickles.
Unless you understand the taste of pickles, I don't think he can be a perfect Japanese [# aside from "perfect Japanese"]. And again, I think-there is something in common between pickles and haiku [# "something" has an emphasis mark]. -
