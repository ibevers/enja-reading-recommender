In making a novel-I wouldn't go to use nature by any means. Even when two men and women who fell in love with each other pass through Yokomachi while talking, the tone of the story is quite different between sunny weather and rainy weather. Even though it is natural, it is not limited to the sea or mountains. Even indoors, shoji, sliding doors, and other words can crawl into the natural part. Therefore, even when writing about the room, we cannot overlook nature. Also, speaking late at night and speaking to Hakusetsu are different from each other, so don't go to the outside of the nature in Seihi Zhou. Uh. If you choose a place in Tokyo city and make it Kanda, there is a natural nature peculiar to that area. To put it another way, in many of my works, I often think of people after seeing the scenery. "Sanshakukaku" and "Katsushika Sako" naturally made me think of people when I saw the scenery of Fukagawa. However, it's not interesting to do things that hurt your intentions, mainly in nature. I want to use it moderately.
