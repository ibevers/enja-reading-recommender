"Picture books without pictures" have very good works.
It is an irreverent story to say that, but I was motivated to think about "poetics without poetry". It is a theme that suddenly came to my mind when I was forced to use the unreasonable title "Notes to the poet".
I rarely read poetry. There is no other reason, so I don't really understand how interesting it is. In the old days of high school, I was a little struck by the literary fever as well. My friends at that time were absorbed in translating foreign poems, but I didn't understand those modern poems. And it seems that it has taken root until today that I have avoided it properly because it seems that I do not understand it.
The poems I sometimes spread are about the Fujimura poetry collection. It's a little embarrassing, but I think that sweet thing was just right for me. However, since the business is totally different, there is no need to be afraid, and he said that Fujimura is just right. And when the other party is a quiet student, I sometimes make a circle with it. I was a little happy that it was Fujimura who taught Japanese poetry to the Japanese who were raised with the consciousness of Chinese poetry. It seems that he really liked that "Kusamakura" that started with "Yunami Kuraku screaming plover", and it has been more than 20 years since he left the Fujimura poetry collection, but strangely, I still remember most of the poems. A young Fujimura who hears the childish voice of the bush warbler in the early spring, which is still cold, on the seaside journey in Mutsu, and feels the dawn of Japanese poetry with the rush of spring tide and the rush of sleep. I have also thought of the appearance of the warbler as if it were a ghost.
Around this time, I wasn't even Fujimura, so I sometimes read poems that look good even when asked by people. It is "Mori Poetry" by Iwanami Bunko. The value is cheap, the type is small, there are many kanji that I don't know, and it takes a long time. When I draw sumi-e, it's especially strange, and no matter what kind of picture I draw or how I feel, if I just look at "Mori Poetry", there is always a phrase that suits the situation well. And when you stamp the seal, the shitajiki is just right, and there is no such handy book.

When you want to discuss the basics of science, the Uniformity of Nature is properly written in the poem of Sakuranbo, so you can quote it.

If you want a phrase that implies social policy or rural policy at that time, it is good. Now is the time for everyone to go crazy with rice, but 78 years ago there was a rice grain utilization research institute in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Forestry. It was said that it was to take it to the sea and throw it away. For those who are wasting a huge amount of national expenses on unreasonable development in the face of global food excess, there are complaints for customizing.

Next to that phrase, the law of Glacier comes out properly. It's a bit indirect, but it's also a bit of a reference for those who are trying to prevent inflation through monetary policy.

There was a little interesting story during the war. In Hokkaido, a newspaper reporter once traveled to rural areas to visit the bereaved families of the war dead. At that time, when he visited the house of the war-injured in a certain village, he said that he responded bluntly, saying, "Injury is not enough." Even after the war, the people are messy. Outside the building where general strikes and other brilliant people are smoking around the stove, snow-capped people are silently exposed to the cold wind, staying up all night waiting for tickets to be sold. I have also.

Is prepared. I didn't have to worry about being scolded at that time because I couldn't understand the kanji I saw for a moment. It's really convenient.
And the good thing about "Mori Poetry" is that you can make very skillful phrases with easy kanji. One day, while drawing a picture with Mr. Komiya (Toyotaka), when I played with praise for the poetry specialty, when I said, "It's good because the poetry is easy to write and has good words," Komiya also said, "Fun. I have been agreed.

I don't know what the two phrases are good for, but there is nothing left to depict the appearance of this trip and the feelings of the traveler. He is a genius who holds down a strange point. Perhaps it is a poet.

There is a phrase. This martial arts mausoleum is probably a mausoleum in the hinterland of China, in the land of Kusatsu, where neither war nor culture has much influence. The mossy shrine is a form that has been abandoned by the world, but it is still a shrine that lives in the heart of the unnamed people. The appearance of the environment and the hearts of the people that lead to it are in our hearts as negotiations in the a priori world in these two phrases.

I wrote. It's really free. Of course, there are many difficult characters in Mori poetry, there are many stories, and there are many poems that cannot be read without literature. It is a great scholarship because I wouldn't have walked with a large dictionary or library in my life, which was chased by turbulence and continued on a wandering journey.
However, it is certain that the poetry is not born from scholarship. The power to hold down such a mysterious point is probably natural. However, it is not necessary to draw out a poem, and Akutagawa's Basho theory has a wonderful explanation of the power to hold down this point.

From a position close to science, let's interpret these points in my own way. Today we always borrow a form of logic, whether we write, speak, or even think for ourselves. The form of logic is unpleasantly difficult, but it does not mean anything exactly as it is dealt with in logic. It just means that you are thinking about making a line. There are differences in how to make muscles, but you can't even think about it unless you make muscles in some way.
However, in its primitive form, human mental activity has a wide world before logic in this sense. Of the various accumulations of sensations, there may be many that remain as mere accumulations other than those that appear on the consciousness with some kind of connection. And I think we always have a feeling of admiration for that kind of prenatal consciousness. If poetry is a character that gives us a chance to look into the pre-conscious world, the story becomes extremely simple.
In Aka's "Nature and Life", there is a short sentence "Spring Sorrow".
[# Indent two characters from here]
"Walking in the field, looking up at the hazy sky, listening to the incense of grass, listening to the song of gentle running water, and the wind like stroking, there is a feeling of nostalgia that is difficult to endure. If it is strange, there is no trace already.
I have no choice but to admire the heavenly hometown that can come far away from the spirit. "

This luscious sorrow that "if you try to capture it, it's already a mark" cannot be captured in prose, that is, in the characters that are in our consciousness. Isn't it possible to get sympathy for it only by poetry? In this case, the poetry cannot catch it, so it seems to only give sympathy. Rather, if you catch it, it will no longer be poetry.

Will open the reader's heart to the sorrow that precedes the sorrow of exile.
It seems that only sadness is mentioned, but it is not limited to sadness. I can't express it well because it's something that can't be captured anyway, but our feelings before consciousness, whether it's sadness that precedes sorrow or joy that precedes joy, is empathy for them. , The one that acts as a trigger may be one element of poetry. And if the trigger works well, it will come to the fore. Thinking in this way, it is certain that the story will be much easier to understand at least.

So far, we have used words such as the accumulation of sensations before they became conscious, but this is not really limited to sensations. There seems to be a similar phenomenon in broader mental activities, including more complex emotions and emotions. If you analyze it rigorously and assemble it properly, you should be able to make sense, and therefore it should be able to appear in the text, but it is actually too complicated and subtle, so such an analysis is done. There are feelings that make it impossible to make sense. Rather than being there, most of the mental effects of living human beings are of that kind, and the ones that science and logic can handle are very small. Therefore, there will be a wide range of poetry in the world where "injury is not enough".

If you try to get rid of one phrase by analysis and assembly, that is, explanation, it will be a lot of noise. It's not a story that requires only ten or twenty sheets. Hundreds of explanations will not tell the main story after all. It cannot be expressed without poetry.
This way of thinking is not so much a view of poetry as a scientist, but rather a view of my own poetry, which may be a bitter smile to the eyes of experts. People who often work in rural offices have enthusiastic science enthusiasts who discover the basic principles and are asked for their opinions, which makes it difficult to respond. There seems to be something similar to that. However, as far as I've written so far, I can't help but add some notes to the poet.
Therefore, the note is that every poem wants one theme. The theme can be anything, but anyway, I want you to present one thing in one poem that precedes science and logic in a broad sense. I would like you to take up the sensations and emotions that are deep in our daily consciousness as the theme. It must be something that cannot be captured. If it can be captured, it does not need to be poetry. [# Raise one character from the ground] (July 19, 1947)
