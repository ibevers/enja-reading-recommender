-------------------------------------------------- -----

When I was a student, I was most intimately coming and going with the coterie "Doujin" of the 3rd and 4th "Shinshicho". It is their bad influence that I finally became a writer who was not originally aspiring to be a writer. At all? ――It may be doubtful whether or not there is any chance. At that time, I was dating other Waseda people besides them. It is certain that those people also had a bad influence on me, who is clean.
The people are not outside. They are Konosuke Hinatsu, Yaso Saijo, and Tari Moriguchi, who published the douujinshi "Masked". I went to see Saijo-kun's guest room with a red hat light, together with Makoto Yamamiya. Not only Mr. Hinatsu and Mr. Moriguchi, but also Mr. Yoshie Kogan, who is a teacher, was introduced to the guest room. I can hardly remember what I was talking about at that time. One day, on the night when a ghost story came out, I remember that I was tired of returning to Okubo, who was raining and didn't pass by one person.
However, after that, "Go" started with Mr. Yoshie, and continued with "Gobusata" with Mr. Saijo and Mr. Moriguchi. When I was in Omachi, Kamakura, I moved to Hase, Kiyo, so I sometimes went back and forth with you. The same is true for Hinatsu-kun's eight tatami mats at that time. It was humorous that the wind of the teams blew in from the wall of the room. However, after leaving Kamakura, "later" became estranged from Hinatsu-kun someday. You all seem to be alive. Hinatsu sometimes publishes a long treatise on poetry in Chuokoron-Shin. It seems that the wind between the floors is no longer blowing into the room where the manuscript is written.
