Small shrine
Kenji Miyazawa

The red torii is rushed
Sugi's happy winter clouds
Is the field a continuation of the Hall of Fame?

The well-scraped Japanese paper
Completely like a year
Don't know about the reflection of snow

Kashiko is on one sieve
Purify the incense there
As soon as it comes in

In the snow bank
Well car that squeaks with Rie
I wonder if the field is full of the sound of comfort
