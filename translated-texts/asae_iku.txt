6 am
I straddle the angle
Crane sends an angle
I grab and pull
Rivets can be burned
Tighten iron and iron
That's my job.
Thought can be burned
Connecting people to each other
That's my job.

6 pm
I say
The rally is hard to say
I hear "no objection"
I'm proud
Work goes on,
"There is an objection"
Work can be done
Late night
Cool the face of excitement in the wind and go home
Late night
Digest today's thought
Shine back to tomorrow's work

Walking feet, on the ground
Step by step
I go, the road leading to the dawn
At twelve, I sleep
Tomorrow's work is coming to sleep
I sleep, i sleep
Fatigue escapes and the morning wakes up

6 am,
I straddle the angle
But the position is different
The day before yesterday angle stands vertically
Yesterday's angle hangs sideways
And today
I'm hungry
Work goes on, the road leading to dawn
We move forward
Oh, building up is approaching.
