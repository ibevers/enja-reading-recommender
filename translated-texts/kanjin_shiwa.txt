However, I wonder how about "here and there in the house". In the original poem, the house of Ifusuma must refer to a small house of three or four rooms. In the olden days, Tao Yuanming's poem entitled "Returning to Sonoda's Residence" says, "Protecting me and returning to Sonoda, Hoya Ten Ridge, Kusaya 89 Ma," is something that people are familiar with. Also, in Su Shi's poem, "Toho Kazumaya", or in Lu You's poem, "Fifty years of ritual, at the end, I should have longed for a enthusiast. "Ma" is the meaning of a room, and "Ma" is the meaning of a room. The Toho Kuma-ya and the Yu-Yu-Yu-ma all show the number of "Makazu". It's okay to understand that there is one small house in Kawazoe, even if it's an apricot flower Ichikomura Ryusui Kazumaya, but why is the car dust collection a few houses? Did you understand it? Experts may misunderstand this.
"Everyone monk, Nishimura 89 family", this is a poem by Guo Shomasa, "Spring water 67 ri, sunset 34 family", this is a poem by Lu You. These are the ones that appear here and there in the house.

Looking at Meng Haoran's collection, there are only nineteen wujue left, but in the Tang poetry selection, two [# "two" and "[3]" notes] are taken. However, I like the poem "Dwelling in Jukushu" that I have left behind the most among the nineteen heads. It's a cloud.

In Kosugi Misai's "Tang Poetry and Tang Poet", the phrase of this poem is read as "Stay in Smoke Nagisa [#" Stay "with a white circle emphasis mark]", and the conclusion is "Approaching Tsukihito [#]. "Approaching" is a white circle emphasis mark] ". However, I would like to continue reading "If you stay at Smoke Nagisa [#" If you stay ", a white circle emphasis mark]", and "Close to Tsukihito [#" Close "to a white circle emphasis mark]", read the moon. I want to keep it quiet.
Naho Nobori Tenshoku is a view of the land from the boat, and the tree there is at the end of the open field, so it is far away from people. (If it's close, it doesn't mean that it's a cloud.) Next, the people near Jiang Qing Moon will see the view of the river from the boat. And although it was cloudy when I saw it in the daytime, it seems that Esei is now purified by the moonlight. The moon is, of course, tomorrow, and it feels as big as a basin and terribly close. I don't feel that the moon is approaching me, even though I feel the moon is near tomorrow. I read it as close to Tsukihito, and I don't want to read it when I get closer to Tsukihito.

There are seven poems by Meng Haoran that are listed in the Kara poetry selection, but the features that do not appear in any of them are visible in the complete works. It means that the same letter is overlaid in one poem. For example, there is the following in Gozen, entitled "Send a friend to Kyo."

However, there are not a few cases where the term can be demonstrated by superimposing the same characters.
Meng Haoran's friend Nokyo, which is called Gozen, is one of the good examples, but the following Gozen, which is called Bounro of Bundou (Late Tang), is also included in each phrase. It is thought that the special taste is produced by overlapping the tower characters.

Making Chinese poetry into Japanese is a simple matter, and in fact it depends on the reader's degree of understanding of the immediate poem and the person's insensitivity to Japanese writing, and naturally the same poem. However, the reading is different depending on the person.
I think that the Chinese poetry made by the Japanese should emphasize the tone when reading it in Japan. I have various orders about how to read Japanese style. Next, let's talk a little about what you can think of.
In the Tang poetry selection (Iwanami Bunko book) translated by Matashiro Urushiyama, Li Bai's Echinaka nostalgia is read as follows.

[# Indent 3 characters from here]

[# End of indentation here]

I don't agree with how to cut the punctuation, and above all, I think the overall condition is terrible. "Nari Nishiki, who returns to the Yoshishi family [#" Nari "with a white circle emphasis mark]," I don't like this sentence. "The palace is [#" ha "with a white circle emphasis mark] like a flower," why, instead of reading "the righteous man" in the previous phrase, only this phrase was read as "the palace". You shouldn't read "Nari Nishiki" or "Full of spring hall" now. In addition, it is a mistake to fill up the spring "Haru" and "Den". Spring here is an adjective for the palace, as in the case where the essay says, "Spring clothes are already made in the spring." Since it is not connected to Harumanden, there is absolutely no need to read Manten no Yu as "full of Haruden". I don't like the tone of "the only thing that the Chinese francolin flies [#" only "with the white circle emphasis mark]". I read the whole poem as follows.

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Goujian, defeating Wu and returning,
Nishiki, who returns to the Yoshishi family
Whether it's full of spring hall "Shunden" like a palace flower,
There is a flight of the Chinese francolin, which is just now.
[# End of indentation here]

In Hidekichi Hirano's complete explanation of Kara poetry selection and Michiaki Kanno's detailed explanation of Kara poetry selection, the second phrase is read as "I will return to the righteous family and do my best", but this is different from the usual case, and breathing is second. Since the phrase continues from the phrase to the third phrase at a stretch, avoiding the unpleasant illness of brocade or brocade, just stop with the brocade and the noun, and further the third phrase "Is it full of spring hall?" It should be read in the past form, and the past form should also have a second phrase, and only then will the meaning of the whole poem become easier to understand as a Japanese sentence, and the tone will be rather favorable. It is.

I read this poem when I was in the undecided prison, and I felt it was a really good poem. However, I didn't read the phrase "to you [#" ni "with white circle emphasis marks]" and "#" question "with white circle emphasis marks]", but "you [#" ha "to White circle emphasis mark] Read the return period as a question [# "question hedomo" with a white circle emphasis mark] ". The paperback book notes that "North means those who are in the north, and you are those who are in the north." I understand that you are Hosono. The north must point to Chang'an. At that time, the author went to the land of Basho, and Hosono was away from Chang'an, and he sent a letter from him asking when he would return, waiting for his husband to return. On the other hand, he said, "You haven't had a period to ask your return date," so if you read it as "You haven't had a period to ask your return date," it's completely useless. The original text is also a question, not as a questioner, so there is no need to forcefully read it.
"You haven't asked for your return date yet." I read this phrase as an undecided superintendent, and I thought that I would really get into it. The fact that there is no period yet is really deep.
By the way, when I saw the letter from Hosono and felt the swelling, it was just an autumn night and it was raining. * If you open [# "Kata + Sou no Tsukuri", Level 3 1-87-68], Tomoeyama will be hidden in the rain, and the pond in front of the eaves will be flooded with water. The author felt that the feeling of this time was truly unforgettable for this scene. So, what kind of scissors west * [# "Kata + Sou no Tsukuri", 3rd level 1-87-68] Candlepower story Tomoeyama I wrote that it was raining at night, and it is only by understanding these phrases that these phrases really become. It comes to life. I rejected this by "scissors" the candles of "what" when "to this" Masa "together in the west * [#" piece + making of rain ", 3rd level 1-87-68]. He should talk about the time of the night rain in Toyama. " (In Chen Nobu Jie's "Lu You Poetry Note", he added the poem "What Tode Kiyoshi Poetry, Chiko Sequel" to "What To, What Tokiya, Li Shangyin Poetry, What To Kyosha Nishimado". It is written as "candle". If you follow it, you will read what it is someday.) In the paperback book, read "Should I talk about the time of the night rain in Toyama [#" ka "with a white circle side point]" Moreover, since sometime [# "ka" is followed by a white circle], the "ka" in "Should I talk [#" ka "is a white circle]" is a snake. Yes, this snake foot makes me sick. In the Kanno Domei book, this is west * [# "Kata + Sou no Tsukuri", 3rd level 1-87-68]. "Wa" should be read as "#" Time should be "with a white circle side point]", and "If you talk to Bomoto about the time of Toyama night rain, it is not good to read it. , I put it above and below the two phrases, "but I don't want to obey him. On an autumn night when it rains and rains, I picked up a letter from Hosono and talked to Tomoeyama at that time [# the white circle emphasis mark at that time], holding hands and discussing it with each other. I was impressed with what time it would be possible to do it, so I dared to talk about the time of the night rain at Toyama [# the white circle emphasis mark at the time]. I want to read "should".
The word "together" means holding hands with Hosono. Both of them are west * [# "Kata + Sou no Tsukuri", 3rd level 1-87-68], and the words such as "scissors" show a very close relationship, and I don't think they pointed to someone else. I can't. The phrase "rejection" means that while returning to Chang'an, the heart is far away and the land of the 蜀 蜀. None of them were just placed for the sake of tone.
The four characters of Naho Tomoeyama Yasume have the same characters superimposed on the second and fourth phrases, but this is an inevitable duplication, and due to this duplication, the current scene will be revisited in the future. It is suggested that the author thinks that, and from the beginning, the author at that time also shook the candle to the west * [# "Kata + Sono Tsukuri", Level 3 1-87-68]. It can be imagined that this poem was given.
By interpreting as above, I still think that this poem is a rare and good phrase.
Kosugi Misai's "Tang Poetry and Tang Poet" recorded the four poems of Li Shangyin, but did not finally adopt this poem.

When reading Chinese poetry in Japanese, the injustice of okurigana often becomes a matter of life and death. For example, in the Iwanami Bunko book of the Kara poetry selection, the poem of Cen Shen,

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Chang'an Manri, East, leaving Chang'an in the east
The deceased Nasou Ichigosho: A one-line book of the deceased Nasouman [# "Sorrow" with white circle emphasis marks].
Tamakansai Nozomi Intestinal Full Moon: Tamakansai If you wish, you will be able to enjoy the intestines.
Situation recovery Ming dynasty age exemption.
[# End of indentation here]

However, the second phrase of this poem is not "deceased Nazo regret [#" regret "with white circle emphasis mark]", but "deceased Nazo regret ya [#" regret "with white circle emphasis mark]". Is. Just reading "regret" as "regret" makes the whole meaning completely useless here. This poem by Cen Shen is entitled "Let's go to Lee's book in Chang'an at Tamaki", and the deceased in the poem is Lee's book, and a letter came from this friend. Because he didn't have it, he complained, "I'll miss even the book of the deceased Nazo."
The second phrase of Jueju is called Jueju, and it is the one that accepted the phrase. Therefore, when reading Jueju in Japanese, in many cases, the first phrase should not be read completely. Is good. For example, Meng Haoran's poem mentioned earlier,

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Transfer boat night Smoke Nagisa: If you move the boat and stay at Smoke [# "If you stay", a white circle emphasis mark],
Higurashi Customer Shinshin: At nightfall, the customer Shinshin.
Nozori Tenshoki: Nozori and the heavenly tree is low.
Esei Tsukijin: Close to Ekiyo Tsukihito.
[# End of indentation here]

Even so, as I have already written, in Kosugi Misai's "Tang Poetry and Tang Poet", the phrase is read as "Move the boat and stay at Smoke Nagisa [#" Stay "with a white circle emphasis mark]". It's hard to say, but I think it's better to continue reading to the next phrase, "If you stay at Nagisa [#" Seba "with a white circle emphasis mark]".

[# Indent 3 characters from here]

That's right

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
If you move the boat and stay at Nagisa

That's a little bit, but I think it feels very different.
Meng Haoran's poem, which was also mentioned earlier,

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Kimito Aoun Departure: You climbed Aoun and left [# "Leave" with a white circle emphasis mark],
Yuzuru Aoyama Yuu Aoyama wants Aoyama and goes home.
Unyama, Konobetsu, Unyama, different from this,
Tear 薜 蘿 Cloth: Tears are moistened 薜 蘿 《Heira》 Cloth 《Koromo》.
[# End of indentation here]

In particular, in this case, the two phrases are paired with each other, so by all means, "You climb up the blue cloud and leave [#" leave "with a white circle emphasis mark]" and continue reading next. I want to. In general, no matter where the two-phrase kinematic pair is placed, (in the literary poem, the third and fourth phrases, the fifth and sixth phrases are always paired. But even if you say so, it's usually better to keep reading the two phrases.
Let me give you another example of the same thing. Looking at the Li Bai poetry selection of the Iwanami Bunko book, which is reviewed by Koda Rohan, the fifth of the five heads of Yuejoji is

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Kagamiko Mizukisaragi, Kagamiko, Suigetsu-like [# "Nyo" with white circle emphasis marks],
Yuki Onna Nyoyuki, like Yakei, Onna Yuki.
Shinsho Shinnami Shinsho, Shinnami Saku,
Sight eccentricity Sight, spectacle, both eccentric.
[# End of indentation here]

I read that. However, even in this case, the first phrase is "like the moon [#" like "with a white circle emphasis mark]", and we want to continue breathing until the second phrase. I wrote the whole poem, "The water of Kagamiko is like the moon [#" like "with a white circle emphasis mark], and the woman of Yakei is like snow. Shinsho Shinnami screams [# "smiles" with white circles], and the sights are both strange. Read.
As you can see from the example in this Koshijoji, if you continue to read the first and second phrases, the same relationship will often occur again. It exists between the fourth phrase. To give an example, the poem of Li Bai's famous Departing from Baidi Castle can be found in the Iwanami Bunko book.

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Asatsu Hakutei Saiunma, Ayakumo who resigns from the White Emperor in the morning
Senri Jiangling One Day Return: Senri Jiangling One Day Return.
Ryogishi monkey voice non-living: Both banks monkey voices do not live [# "do not live" with white circle emphasis marks],
Mt. Manju, Mt. Manju, a mountain of Mt.
[# End of indentation here]

However, in this case as well, the third phrase is still read as "Monkeys on both banks screaming and living" [# "Marazunani" with white circle emphasis marks] "and breathing. I want to continue until the end.
Here are just two more examples that apply to the above.

Continuation of cautions regarding reading Chinese poetry in Japanese.
When reading Chinese poetry in Japanese, the past form of the verb is sometimes absolutely necessary. For example, in the Iwanami Bunko book, Zhao * [# "Old + (Leisure-Day)", 241-12] in the Tang Poetry selection

[# Indent 3 characters from here]

The same person, Tsukihito, who came in the same way and shook the moon [# "Human" with a white circle emphasis mark].

[# End of indentation here]

However, if you don't read "Shinbu [#" Bu "with white circle emphasis marks]" as "Shinbi [#" Bishi "with white circle emphasis marks]", the conclusion will not work.
In some cases, it is also necessary to use guessing auxiliary verbs. For example, in the Iwanami Bunko book, Li Yi's * [# "Sanzui + Bian", Level 3 1-86-52] Kawano, also in the Tang Poetry Selection,

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
* [# "Sanzui + Bian", 3rd level 1-86-52] Suito-ryu Mugen Spring * [# "Sanzui + Bian", 3rd level 1-86-52] Suito-ryu endless spring,
Sui family palace palace dust. It becomes dust in the palace palace of the Sui dynasty.
Nozomi Nagatsumi, a pilgrim
Kazeki Yangka murder: Kazeki [# "re" with white circle emphasis marks] If Yangka people are murdered [# "su" with white circle emphasis marks].
[# End of indentation here]

However, the conclusion is that I want you to read "Kazeki et al. [#" Ra "with white circle emphasis marks] and Yang Hanjin [#" Sen "with white circle emphasis marks marks]".
There are endless examples of this, but here I will list only one Lu You's lyrics (this is not a poem, but a so-called loose poem). This one head contains phrases that should use guessing auxiliary verbs and past verbs before and after.

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Koin squirrel sleepy spring greed, Koin silk moth sleeps and spring old

The title of the poem of Reiharu, if you recite the poem of Reiharu,
Mirrored 鬢 颢 絲 Mirrored 鬢 Itozoe Hinishika [# "Soe Hinishika" with white circle emphasis marks].
[# End of indentation here]

On the right, I read it for a trial, but since this verb is a tribute to the thoughts of the time when the author was in Kinjo (Chengdu), the fourth phrase is "like the old days of the emphasis marks. Do not read "#" like "with white circle emphasis marks"], but be sure to use the auxiliary verb "like the old days [#" like "like" with white circle emphasis marks marks] ", and the conclusion is" mirror ". It must be in the past as "Auxiliary verbs with white circles on" # "Auxiliary verbs" instead of "Emphasis marks with white circles on" Auxiliary verbs "."

It is good to read Chinese poetry, but there is often a theory that it is a complete story to make a Chinese poem by yourself by trying hard to imitate the Chinese people. (I remember now, one day, Konosuke Hinatsu [# Note on "[suke]" in "suke"] wrote such a thing, and also in Kosugi Misai's "Tang Poetry and Tang Poet". That's what it says.) But I generally disagree. In fact, I myself have been imitating Chinese poetry these days by examining the tone and rhyming. I don't necessarily think it's ridiculous.
Why do you imitate Chinese poetry? (Imitation is not humble, its meaning is gradually stated.)
The reason above all is that kanji and Chinese writing may be the most suitable for expressing one's thoughts and feelings. However, if that's all, it's okay to mix kana, but if you mix kana, it's not very interesting to see with your eyes. So, if you want to emphasize the use of kanji anyway, there is a request that you want to see only kanji without mixing kana, and if you want to see only kanji anyway, let's look at the form of Chinese poetry that Chinese people tried. That is to say.
However, even if we take the form of Chinese poetry, we do not read it as a stick, but read it in the Japanese style, so we comply with various poetry rules developed in China due to temperament. do not have to. That is the characteristic of Chinese poetry made by the Japanese in order to read it in Japan as Japanese poetry.
Originally, the pronunciation of kanji has changed considerably in China for thousands of years, so even in modern Chinese people, for example, the author of the Tang dynasty intended to have people read it. I don't read Tang poetry with a naive pronunciation. (Actually, the Tang poetry was divided into 206 parts, but the Song rhyme was only 106 parts. Therefore, it should be inferred that there is a remarkable change in pronunciation.) Chinese Because it is so, modern Japanese people have to investigate the tone, rhyme and other things of Tang poetry in detail and try to make something as close to Tang poetry as possible, and if they want to make Chinese poetry, they have to make Tang poetry. It cannot be considered that it is so meaningful except as a kind of nostalgic hobby (although it seems that people like Kainan Mori adhered to the rhyme) to struggle with the wind. ..
For example, it is unavoidable to follow the rules of tone, rhyme, and even number, which are written in ordinary introductory books. But going further, for example, when it comes to the last letter of a non-rhyming phrase, I wasn't satisfied with just making it a tones, and in the first tones it was a checkered letter. In the second 聯, you should use the upper voice or the rhyme character other than the incoming voice, and in the third 聯, if you use the upper voice character in the second 聯, you should definitely use the rhyme character. Today, I went into the place where I had to use the four tones in detail, and the various pains that the poet of the Tang dynasty had spent on the rhyme were taken away. Aside from special experts, Japanese, who are completely different languages, scrutinize each and every one of them and try to reproduce them as much as possible on the poems they make. For ordinary people, it is a completely meaningless effort.
On the contrary, in some cases, it is okay to ignore the rules of tone that everyone who makes Chinese poetry has been concerned about. That is the knowledge of Chinese poetry made by the Japanese in the Showa era. I think in a cute way.
For example, in the special theme of Saigo Nanshu,

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
I've been working on spicy acid several times, and I've been working on it for a while.
Durable swordsman [# "Shinzen" with white circle emphasis marks] Durable smashing, swordsman 《Senzen》.
Wagaya Remains Corporation Knowledge: As soon as we know the law of our family,
Unscrupulous grandchildren buying Mita: You should buy Mita for your grandchildren.
[# End of indentation here]

There is a saying that I wanted to make the tiles complete, but I avoided the tiles of the syllabary because of the tone pattern, but if the Japanese wrote it with the intention of having the Japanese read it, here etc. It is better to break the rules of Tone and use the tiles that are familiar to our ears, and there is a word for smashing the tiles, but there should be no such word as 甎 膳.
Similarly, in Nanshu's accidental seven extinctions,

[# Indent 3 characters from here]
Daesung Sake Zatakaro: Calling out loud sake and sitting in the high-rise building
Goki 將 呇 Five Great States: Five great states that are swallowed by a courageous general.
1 inch Tanshin 3 shaku sword, 1 inch Tanshin, 3 shaku sword,
Volunteer [# "Shiramaru Emphasis Mark"] Preliminary Neikan Head: The head of the pre-trial Neikan who tries first by voluntarily wielding a sword.
[# End of indentation here]

On the other hand, there is a Chinese poet who criticizes that the sword of the concluding remark is not suitable for the sword, so instead of the sword of the sword, a sword of the sword should be used. , I am very dissatisfied. When reading this in Japan, there is a force of words because the sword continues, saying, "One inch of a three-shaku sword, sword." Even if you ignore that point, this is a sword character. If you twist it repeatedly, it will not be a poem. It doesn't have to be a problem, whether it's fair or not. I think about it.
By the way, if you say such a thing, some people may say that it is okay not to make it a problem from the beginning, but that is fine. However, if you put the tone together, even if the Chinese read it as a stick, it will be a little better than if the tone is not matched, so originally read it to the Chinese. Even if it's not about getting things, it's better not to ignore the rules of tone. I think about it.
Originally, kanji are hieroglyphs, which are completely different in character from Roman letters and Japanese kana, and require that the shape of the letters be seen with the eyes, in addition to transmitting the sound to the ears. It is a hieroglyph. In many cases, the characters such as day, moon, mountain, and river are half-pictured, and sadness, sadness, tears, and 泪 have meanings in their bias. So, regardless of how Japanese people insulate from this kanji, as long as they are used as daily characters, they will not be insensitive due to the special taste and beauty of the kanji when written on paper. Therefore, for poems that respect subtle sensations and beauty, there is no choice but to request that only kanji be viewed side by side without mixing kana. (The Japanese text, which is a mixture of hieroglyphs, musical notes, and characters with completely different personalities, is very messy to the eye. .) Half of the Japanese demand for Chinese poetry comes from there.
I think about it as above, so if a professional Chinese poetry sees it, it's as if the rules aren't in the poetry. I'm calmly making something that is criticized as being terribly poor, but at the same time, on the other hand, in terms of reading and tone when making this a Japanese reading (this is a Chinese person). I don't know at all.) It puts a lot of weight on it.
It looks like Chinese poetry, it is made up of only kanji, but its pronunciation and how to read it are completely Japanese reading. Kauifu is a Japanese Chinese poem that is made by the Japanese, can be made by the Japanese, and is meaningful to the Japanese. It is not a foreign poem, like the English poem written by Yone Noguchi. It is not a Chinese poem, but a Japanese poem that belongs to the same category as Japanese poetry and haiku. Everything must be standardized, and by standardizing it, it is meaningful for the Japanese in the Showa era to write Chinese poetry for the first time.
The above is my view. I've never seen anyone say this. However, I am quite confident in this style. What is not enough is to supplement the section again.

Kosugi Misai's "Tang Poetry and Tang Poet" describes the following things.
[# Indent two characters from here]
"It's a friend's story, but when Ginkō Kishida of China in the first year of the Meiji era talked about Japanese poetry with the writers who met there, Seigan Yanagawa and other famous poets in Japan I added the work of that unknown person to the work, and when I showed them to them on purpose, except for the name of the author, they all took the part of that unknown person. I asked what the poor poetry was good for. Their answer was uniformly to endure the scrutiny aside from the unknown, and Seigan and others are interesting, but what? The reason was that I couldn't agree with it because of its vulgar tone. (Omitted) Yanagawa Seigan is a rule that makes this Ginkō musical. Perhaps the Japanese poet is a real writer. I would say this rule more loudly than that, but because the knowledge of the four voices of the original sound is not as good as that of other children, it is a laborious effort. By arranging five or seven kanji characters in a row, first make a poetry that is difficult for ordinary Japanese to read, and then break down the rhyme, and it is not prized by the authentic Chimpung Kampung, and it is not prized for Japanese reading. It's irrelevant, nothing. "
[# End of indentation here]
It is said that the liberation is nothing, but in Japan nowadays, new introductory books such as Chinese poetry are still published, and the ones such as Shigin (I like the tone of this Shigin). It's still popular (although it's not). This fact cannot be explained simply by making a fool of it.
The Chinese poetry read in Japan is Japanese poetry, not Chinese poetry. When Chinese poetry is viewed as Chinese poetry by Chinese people, it is better if it is still worth appreciating, but even if it is not, it is made to read in Japan. The Japanese Chinese poetry that was created does not prevent the Japanese poetry from maintaining its independent existence value.

Haruo Sato's poem is written only in kana, which adds to its beauty. At the very least, it escapes the ugliness that results from the mixture of kanji and kana. Some people write waka poems in Man'yogana because they avoid the ugliness of writing them on paper, and when painters write their own works, they dislike sentences with mixed kana. For the same reason. If you mix hieroglyphs, musical note characters, and characters with completely different personalities, you cannot write beautifully no matter how much you devise. This is because the characters themselves are crowded. This is the reason why Japanese poems and haiku, which are a mixture of kanji and kana, are usually written on small strips, and Chinese poetry is written on large paper sheets.
It is because of the beauty of hieroglyphs that calligraphy developed only in China. In the Roman alphabet, no one enjoys writing.
The appeal of kanji is one of the reasons why Japanese people still write Chinese poetry.

When I showed this to a person for a trial, he said that the translated poem was quite good, but there was no special taste when the original poem was read in Japanese. .. It's a plausible story. And, of course, it may be due to my ingenuity, but our sense of Japanese reading from the Chinese style or Chinese poetry style is originally unique, and there are other expressions that should be replaced. There is no such thing.
Haruo Sato's collection of car dust consists of translations of Chinese poetry close to fifty heads, but the original poems are all girls' works, so-called Yuru Fengyun's little child and girl's affection. It's not necessarily a coincidence. This is because it is relatively easy to express these kinds of things in Japanese, which does not depend on kanji. For the same reason, it is no coincidence that the priests at the time of the Meiji Restoration liked the spirit of Fengyun and turned to Chinese poetry. They had a depressive spirit in their hearts that could not be expressed without borrowing Chinese characters and Chinese poetry. Even in the poem of General Nogi's "Seima | Soot, standing in the sunshine outside Jinzhou Castle", there is no suitable expression other than the form of the Chinese. Whether you look at it or not, it doesn't matter at all from the beginning.
The oil paintings and water paintings drawn by the Japanese are no longer Western paintings, but Japanese paintings, and Chinese poetry has been a Japanese poem for a long time. This is related to the fact that Kanji has already become a Japanese character.
Today, the pronunciation of our Kanji characters is the same as that of the original and Chinese characters, but the modern Japanese maintain a pronunciation system that is completely different from that of the modern Chinese. As for what to say, Japanese kanji is no longer the only national character in Japan. And such Japanese-style kanji have been completely integrated into the Japanese language over a long period of time and have taken root deeply, and today our language is understood without the help of kanji. It's something you can't get. For example, even if it is a tank or an airplane, it doesn't make sense unless you apply the kanji to it. If you don't apply it, it doesn't make sense.
The likes and dislikes of having Kanji so much in Japanese life over the years are another matter. It may have been an unfortunate event due to the development of Japanese language. However, as long as the Japanese use the good or bad kanji as daily characters, it is unreasonable to arrange the kanji in five or seven characters to create what is called loose Chinese poetry. It's not a story that can't be helped. However, we only need to be aware that it is Japanese poetry and autonomously devise a unique law that is different from the Chinese poetry.

This is a poem by Sou * [# "Karma + Ozato", Level 3 1-92-83] "Sougefu" (late Tang), entitled "Karma" in the North Guo. He is from Gui prefecture and is said to have become a provincial governor of Yang prefecture, but I don't know where both Gui prefecture and Yang prefecture are. (When I looked it up later, Guizhou was now Guilin County, Guangxi Province, and Yang County was now Yang County, Shaanxi Province.) However, this poem is probably in a place far away from the author's hometown. It's just a matter of thinking that it will be a work. The north wall is probably the mountain castle of the place where it was assigned, and the Yamamae mountain back sword green grass is because the front and back of the mountain where the castle is located are all fields or fields. The gate is the gate of Yamashiro. You can go in and out of the gate all day long. What is it that goes in and out so much?

The phrase feels painful. I live far away from my old mother, but the feelings of thinking about my old parents and the feelings of loving my grandchildren are different. Looking at the conclusion of this poem, I think it must have been that the author had a grandchild or a younger child at that time. Going out of the gate and seeing the mercy (caressing) of Noo's descendants is a phrase that can only be done by someone who has the experience of caressing their own descendants.
