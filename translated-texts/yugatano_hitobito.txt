My daughters,
A couple of people in the evening town
From the stern brick back gate
Daughters being spit out,
Put a face powder [# "Emphasis mark" on your face] neatly on your face.
Wear the shrimp tea hakama with the correct creases,
I have weather clogs in my white socks, but
Inside the furoshiki wrap that you hold in your hand
It's like a bento box, white office clothes, and sandals with a red hanao.
While happily talking with friends about small talk and future dreams,
How fun it was while I was in town,
But if you go home,
Many sisters and younger brothers,
Dad's gatekeeper hasn't returned yet,
Mother's internal work is scattered in the tatami room,
Even the side with the desk of the small six tatami mats
Messed up with children's toys.
You will then feel how far the distance between fantasy and reality is,
Kimono shop window "Show Wind",
Booth shop window "Show Wind",
You want that big yukata,
I want a half-collar of lily sewing on celadon,
But my daughters in the evening
You are the temptation of a lascivious chief,
You have to be afraid of the bad eyes of your superiors,
Young girls in the evening who seem to be lonely.

You're wearing a rat-colored summer outfit,
You put it on your shirt, deer
But neither the color nor the tie suits you,
You are wearing old clogs with bare feet.
What a black face you have,
What a dull face you have,
It â€™s very different from the red-faced factory owner who is fat with beer.
You hurry back to your evening home,
To the house where the mother and the newborn boy are waiting this spring.
What a serious, serious, face that seems to endure any pain,
That manly, but a little cloudy, messy face,
And thick arms and strong hands,
A fine type of Japanese worker that wasn't completed until just ten years ago,
I just saw a Western strike in just one activity photo,
But there were many serious faces like you.

Passing Tsukishima in the evening,
From the city of Tokyo to the slums on the island
From the second floor of a high factory to a small building split Nagaya
The delivery of Daidenma, which is pulled by a steamship with the crest of Tokyo City,
Mothers and daughters with hair that is tightly squeezed and crossed [# "Emphasis mark"]
I laugh so much when something is wrong,
What makes you laugh so much,
Shabby yukata, slender belly band,
Tanned face, reddish hair,
I see, you are free from now until tomorrow morning,
That makes you laugh so much,
You can't make a joke while working,
But now I'm free,
You wanted to laugh, laugh, laugh,
The young girl is also laughing at what is so interesting in one place,
However, the blue-faced ginkgo [# "ginkgo" side point] return woman does not laugh.
The grandmother who had her eyes [# "emphasis mark"] didn't laugh, either.
It's a face that I've never laughed at.
Steam burns coal more and more,
I'm pulling the ship in the busy evening.

The factory whistle rang here and there,
If it's a rose-colored summer evening,
People who come from nowhere,
There was a kid with a smirking face on it,
Sora, there were three young female workers on board,
Sora, the man of Hanten was on board,
There was a man wearing a hakama,
There was a dirty navy blue collar on it,
There was an old man on it,
A ferry of Denma that fills up quickly.
If you look at it
Everyone's washed-out yukata
Clogs on bare feet,
Or in a red summer hat, this is the only white shoes of summer mercy,
The small furoshiki wrapping in my arm is, needless to say, an open box for lunch.
The smell of sweat, the smell of hair,
Although they work to grow heroically,
What a tan on the face, thin cheeks, dull hair,
It's so shabby,
You're hungry both physically and mentally like this,
If you think about it
I think it's not so beautiful to be born.
