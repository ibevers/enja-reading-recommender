"Nobuko" was written in about three years from around 1924. Just after the end of the First European War, and in the years that followed, a young Japanese woman was given a middle-class, driven by her desire to grow as a person and a woman. It depicts the reality of opening one's own path while flapping with all one's might in an environment.
After the First European War, awareness of a democratic society grew in Japan, and the movement to be released from the old class society and its literature began to emerge. However, the author of "Nobuko" did not own such a new development of history at that time. The anguish and desire of "Nobuko" was portrayed as the cry of a human being, a woman who could not accept the customs of the established society.
With the first volume of "Nobuko", the author has taken advantage of the positive and negative aspects of the environment in which he has been alive. In order to seek more natural and more relaxed humanity, we had to change the social environment in which we live and make a historic leap in our understanding of life and literature.
How was this difficult but unavoidable attempt for all living honestly experienced on the same heroine? It hasn't been drawn yet.
