When crossing that mountain
We were steamed like a locomotive
There was a lot of stuff
Suddenly the wind came and sent me a lump of white snow.
The water in the water bottle stabbed the inside of the mouth like glass
When crossing that mountain
We were a burning camphor tree
Now that mountain is black
On top of that, the Orion star is shining.
Leaning on your backpack
It was on the ground
The wind came again and it rained on our faces
