The United States seems to be quite interesting. But I know very little, so very vaguely, the literature that changed with the changes that America's prosperity suffered after 1929, gradually growing, and more and more good people in Europe. I am interested in what kind of culture the "American brightness" that receives and deepens the nuances will create, and how a culture with a relaxed spirit and economic power will grow.
