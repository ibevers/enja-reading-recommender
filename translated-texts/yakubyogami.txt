This is an experimental story of Ms. Shigure Hasegawa, but the ratio of Ms. Ms. Tsukudajima to Tsukudajima and her younger sister, Haruko, suffered from typhoid fever. I was sleeping on the second floor of the detached house, so I was always taking care of the pillow head.
It was night, but at that time a sick person was being struck. Ms. casually looked towards the alcove. In the corner between the alcove, there was a boy of about 156, who was crouching with his arms crouched, but his hair seemed to be scorched, and his face was rotten with an elongated eggplant. It was a face like that. Ms. Ms. was surprised, but she had heard about the plague god for some time, so she thought that if she lost here, the sick person would die, so she put a lot of effort into her lower abdomen and glared at the boy. Then, the boy disappeared like smoke, and Haruko, who had been screaming, woke up from her dream.
In the meantime, Haruko's illness was completely healed, so Ms. went out to Hakone. I took a train in Kouzu and went to Odawara by train, but when the train went to the stop of Yukimachi Saiwaicho in Odawara, I casually looked out the window. , There was a boy who was vaguely armed, leaning against a large telephone pole with the name of the stop. It was a boy with a rotten complexion of his eggplant.
Ms. Ms. glared at her lower abdomen again. The boy disappeared again.
