There is one thing that is always embarrassing when I go to buy a child's book. That is, every book tries to put a lot of content into one page, and even the pictures are really stubborn, ignoring the childish feeling of growth.
My little nephew has a great deal of love for Fukuchan. However, I don't feel like buying a Fuku-chan picture book. Divide one page into several pieces, and let's show the children Fuku-chan, which is drawn with a relaxed and comfortable line, just as it is, with the narrowness of one frame of the newspaper picture as it is, just packed tightly. There is no consideration of love or humor.
Because it was a good book for children, it was of great interest to all parties, so I would like to raise this point to the general public's attention. I think that the space that allows children's imagination to move is indispensable on the pages of children's books. The child's heart will be filled with passiveness as he opens up and looks at the rugged pages that are spoken from corner to corner. Even in the math books of the first grade of elementary school, I can feel the pity that there is not enough space on this page. I think that good books must respect the livelyness of the child's psychological intonation in addition to the morality of the content.
