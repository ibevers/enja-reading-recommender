[# 5 indentation] Introduction [# "Indentation" is a big heading]
It is noble and dignified, and it is the first time to be clear and clear. Poetry is the mystery of illusion, filled with emptiness and filled with emptiness.
Bird * [# "self" instead of "white" in "Sakai + Sagi no Tsukuri", 3rd level 1-90-35], is it just an ordinary line? Play with the water of the seal, and let's only recognize it as someone else's hard work. The clouds are ancient and young, the waves are near, and I don't know the life when I return.
Poetry is my natural way. I like the genius of that expression and squeeze the bones. 畢竟 enjoys my two pleasures with me. However, I am ashamed that I have not yet reached the god of humor, and I am ashamed that I will not be able to get rid of the scars of my grief.
Because it was too far away as desired, it drooped deeply.

I'm riding quietly,
A bright, flattened figure.
Mutsu-majisa, no-no-kazari,
Oh, this discipline.
The daughter raised the paddle, and again,
Parents are crouching and tired of cultivating.
It's a very nice day, I wonder if there is
Fine dust shines on the ears of reeds,
If the view of the swamp spreads,
Mugucho crows. Let something sprout.
Nothing, warmth,
Oh, this discipline.
Spring sunrise big sunset "Irihi",
A distant, lonely straw roof, withered Yang.
Everything is in good light, of the cow
Dwell in a peaceful and deep eye.
Oh, this intimacy, insidiousness,
Everything is in bright prayer.

[# 5 indentation] Postscript [# "Postscript" is a big heading]
There is a vast universe even in a single word. While I am examining this universe day and night, my relatives are also rushing to the shadow of unknown surprises and grief. In other words, just like the life of Kotodama and the fact that it is emitted from an atom with a fine dust number that is always invisible to the eye, and the action of that bacterium, I think of it as terrifying.
It is the apostle of Kotodama that the essence of each word, its connection, and the formation of rhythms should always be delicately tasted, and the smelting, filtering, blacksmithing, creation, etc. should be the way of residence. Whatever is not the only best work of a person. I scrutinize as Hoho. You can lose weight by elaboration. However, as mentioned in the introduction, there is no way to go for it. The bitterness of the elaboration is my irreplaceable pleasure, and my own madness is also irreplaceable.
What is the vitality of the fine dust atoms in a single sound? This atom-by-atom life is integrated in the form of miscellaneous species for the first time, depending on the poet's spirit, thoughts, emotions, sensations, and the speed and tuning of the soul and flesh. It is melted and revealed. The poet's spirit is in the sound of each word that he ingests, and it already emits light as a gyokuro, like a pollen, as a 芬 芬.
Therefore, I think that I should just smile at the words of lack of recognition, such as no thought in Hakushu, just by looking at the enjoyable duo of words and sensations. I will no longer live in an undeveloped world that is indignant.
Regarding my recent trends in poetry, I would like to talk about the various editions of "Ancient Shinto" in this book, or "Old Chicken" and "Sea Panther and Clouds" in "White [#" White "is Mama] Kachozu". "Cape Shioshu", "In the mountains of Kabata", "Ohotsuku Sea on a cloudy day", "Old Ainu song", etc. The spirit of Japanese Ko-Shintō, which has reached the recognition of modern gods, is to be rebuilt in this modern era. I call back from the vague Fudoki with the ancient affairs, Nihongi, Fudoki, and congratulatory words, and pray for the resurrection of the ancient god with the power of Kotodama. I'm looking for it. As one of the Japanese people, I cannot easily follow the idea of ​​the Far West fashion.
Also, thinking about it, catching the ancient gall bladder is not the same as catching the ancient dead language. It is the rhythm of ancient emotions that are lively and vibrant that you can grasp with your bare hands. I wonder if I've finally learned a little bit.
On the other hand, I secretly tried to scent the modern ghost body between moonlight, flowers and birds, and ancient times. Some of the volumes such as "White [#" White "is Mama] Kachozu", "Moonlight's 谿", "Fairy Tales Moon", and "Hanayo" are mentioned.
I also tried to learn the poetry boundary by picking up poetry materials as me in my trip or daily life. "Golden Mist", "Early Spring in the Water Town", "Meng Zong's Figure", "Spring Mosquitoes", "Sea Panther and Clouds", "Night of Beads and Crafts", etc.ゐ.
I enjoy the freshness of nature and life that occurs in [# 2 character dot, 1-2-22]. In feeling the old blue things anew, the endless fragrance, miscellaneous colors, and brilliance are the scenery in front of me. It is human happiness to be able to live and enjoy things. However, the perspective of the outlook is slightly different from that of the so-called optimist in the world. Even in the graveyard life of Tennoji, my "joy of life" made me trap from the bottom of my heart. By the way, I made him think about myself who should be humble * [# 2 character dot, 1-2-22].
When it comes to poetry expression, I put the best of the flow of air as if I was breathing. A voice that has no shape, no shape, no color, no scent, and no voice that can be captured is just like the voice of the heart. I hate the use of bizarre or fictional literature. This is because the importance of poetry expression lies in the sound, not in the letters. It is in the fluctuation of the sound without voice that should not be lost even if it is aloud. The supreme technique is pure, and even a slight noise and a fine pebble on its tongue are acceptable. I'm most reluctant to alienate and 衒 耀.
I am constantly laying myself on the squeezing tree of elaboration in search of the fineness of each word. However, I can't imagine the weakness of forgetting the big picture by seasoning only the delicate rhymes. I think that the sound should be subtle, the heart should be thick, and sometimes it should be free-spirited, in order to be simple with ancient Kamo. It depends on the poetry material and the impression.
However, I hope for it. However, I do not have the pride that my poetry itself is considered as a finished work that I should prove. Rather, I know too much about my immaturity today. I don't think I would dare to quit the pain of the eleventh poem because I knew too much about its deficiencies and suffered ten times as much as other people.
In this collection, I praised poetry works for about eight years after "Sumi-e". From the life before and after the earthquake at the mountain lodge in Odawara, which was blessed with bamboo grove, Omori was one on the hill overlooking the moonlight of Magome during the temporary era of 18 Yanaka Tennoji, which lived next to the rosary. The year has changed during this time. During these long days, I hesitated to publish a volume of what should be my primary poetry collection because I was too deep to know about my own incompleteness. is there. I don't think I was too inclined to love myself. The conscience was unforgivable.
