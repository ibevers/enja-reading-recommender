Brief Message from the Heart.
From today's Kei Ki [# Note to "Kido Takayoshi" in "Ki Kei"], I entered the page for a while. The same person is a person who is familiar with the affairs of the kingdom, and after he was strong for the first time, a woman and others are likely to be ill.
The debate of your country is deeply rooted, and it is a wish and a statement.
