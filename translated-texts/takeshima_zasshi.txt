Rabbits and horns are the same as his minister, and it is not clear to the world what the island is like, but it may be that there are no houses. By the way, the character of Tamnajima appears in "By the way", and the fact that it should not be made of bamboo is written in the sword.

The color is ash and the address is like a swallow. The belly is also white. In the name of the fishermen, it is called a hole bird. I heard that there are many [no] rocks in the west cave of Takenoura * [# "de", 526-12 instead of "eyes" in "mountain / eyebrows"]. [# End of warichū]
Sea bass [# warichū] This fish is called "malebui" in the sea of Hizen, Hirado, and Goto. It's like a small dog. The surface is extremely greasy like a fish (catfish). Make it fair and waxy and □□. If you put it in a kettle and add water to boil it, it will boil and float on the top surface. When you take it, add water and simmer it, it's like the beginning of recovery. There is no time to go back again and again. If you boil the fisherman, you will get a lot of oil, so I like it. This fish wind wave may not sleep on the reef. At that time, Ya goes around from the leeward side and stabs with a spear. [# End of warichū]

Cinnabar ｜ Patina 《Rokushiyau》 etc. Yes [# Warichū] All of them have to write down the oral tradition on the fisherman's oral tradition. This rock patina is called water patina at the copper mine in Ani, Akita, Hashu, but I think it is not correct.

Many pine trees are produced, and huge materials are produced. Yuka Hana, I heard that there are many in the mountains. If you peel off the skin and operate it, there is nothing else. I mean, in ginseng. In addition, Shimachu Dai Hirano garlic will be produced. If you put it in the diary of Ezo, and also in the diary of Sado, you will find that it is a luxury now, but there are a lot of gold copper, silver copper, lead, etc. that produce this kind. In producing the situation, cinnabar on this island, and rock patina. The practitioner is sutegana [# "(ku)" is a small line on the right side of the line]. Patina is made up of gold, silver, and copper, and cinnabar is produced because of the presence of vermilion, tin, and mercury.

Inspecting the key to the richness of the country and its climate, observing some of the fish shrimp, bird swords, giant wood, and bamboo stones, giving them the skill of cultivating and weaving equipment, and entrusting the inconvenience of boats. He tried the bamboo trees, flowers and fruits of the shrimp and the cereal vegetation that were soberly produced, and taught him to sow and cultivate "Tsuchikafu". Shrimp [# "(ku)" is written on the right side of the line] Also, if you are in the mausoleum and do not know the geography of the person who is in charge of national affairs, you will be lost. A person who proposes a soldier to conquer a soldier. When he knows the geography, he is lost in a dangerous place. Watari * [# "Foot + Ayumu", U + 8E04, 528-2] If you don't know the geography, you will lose your speed. [# Warichū] An excerpt from Koichijo Mikuni Tsukasa. [# End of warichū] However, according to the theory of the ancient and modern times, and the fact that the sea was protected, there was nothing that was far from the sea, only the things that were inside the seal. Only Tomomichi Tobabayashi wrote Mikuni Tsutomu, and each country adjacent to the empire, Korea, Ryukyu, and the field work "Ezo", * [# "Mouth + Kusakanmuri / (" Kozatohen + Face Hen "" 彡 " Instead, "raw") ", U + 21133, 528-4] I will describe the island" Karafuto "and the uninhabited island" Ogasaharajima ".

However, it protruded into the ocean of Takeshima, and it was a village between Korea and the empire "Wagakuni". However, if you send a ship here and go to the ports in the San'in region, it will not hurt you. Also, if you land on his land and clear the island, there is nothing to compare with. However, this island was handed over to Korea during the year of the former Joseon dynasty. Therefore, he was forced to drift, and he was sent to his place as a volunteer as a fishing rod, and he believed in the different ship of the continent, listened to other rumors, and learned about the situation in the five continents. If you search for it, you will find that it is a miracle [# 1 step small character] [measure] [# small character end]. Also, if there are fishing battalions on the coast, the benefits will be small. In his hometown of Joseon Island, he was handed over to Korea with the virtues of the Mausoleum of the Constitution, and the accident occurred. The deceased land was reclaimed and sweet potatoes | Suzuimo Souma "Narabinigoshiyoimo" were made, and the sweet potatoes "sugar cane" were used as seeds for the "# 1 step small letters" [wrapping] [# small letters end].

I read the diary of Sayoko Shokoku's history of the long breath, and searched for the local people's mouthpieces [# 1 step small letters] [monument] [# small letters end] and saw them in recent years. 《And》 I want you to look like a comrade, with the brush excerpts you hear. I didn't get the time. Around that time, Mr. Tsuda of Asahi-do, a one-day talk, a sea defense talk, reached this island. You deeply mourn this island. Edited and presented the essay. Therefore, there is little theory in the book. Also, Tomomichi Hayashi is compared to Mikuni Tsukasa.
