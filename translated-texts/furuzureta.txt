Old rubbing
Foreign picture book--
Saliva is too neutral

On the road after the rain
I walked but I walked
Ameya can't find

Do you think it's just a sentiment?
--To pay the amount--
Once God did it objectively
-Unreasonably, there is no value in existence
But irrationality is hard for me--
There is speed at the tip like this
Abandoned one after another
Geta teeth
How do you appeal my gravity to the soil?
"I'm lonely that the sky is interesting but useless
--There is no change in the physical phenomenon even in the case of mental exclusion. "
Licking the glass
I don't care about flies
