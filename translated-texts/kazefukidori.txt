Wind "cold" butterbur "dori"
Where do you go with flying
The sea is violent.

Why does it ring
Kaakaa
The mountain is also violent.

It â€™s so expensive
So low
After, it becomes "after", and after, it becomes "before".

Being disliked by everyone
Ringing crying
I will fly.

Put on a black robe and change it
Come.

Tighten the obi of gold
Come.

Next time, in the world of "this time"
I'll make it King.
