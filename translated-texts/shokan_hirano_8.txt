After that, there is no excuse for the lecture and the quarterly report in the form of abandonment. I had recurrence of appendicitis about 10 days ago, so I was forced to rest for the time being. Thank you for the lecture and "Capital Theory". The manuscript for the course I am in charge of is ready for the time being, so I will make it in time for the writing during the bed rest and the 6th distribution.
In addition, Mr. Sadayo Tatewate (former name Mr. Orimoto) sent me a letter like the one enclosed, but I am sorry that I can not make it in time due to the circumstances on the right, but I am sorry to trouble you, but I will bother you to reply instead. Would you like to translate it? If there is a difference, it may be my name, stating that it will be a ghostwriter during illness. Thank you for your cooperation.
I pray to Mr. Tokibushi for your health. [# Raise one letter from the ground] Best regards
[# Raise 3 letters from the ground] Eitaro worship
Mr. Hirano
