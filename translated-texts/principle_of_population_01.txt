Chapter 1 Summary of the problem-Population and food growth rate
The research method for this problem that naturally appears in research on social improvement is as follows.
First, to explore the causes that have traditionally hindered human progress toward happiness, and
Second, consider the probability of total or partial elimination of such causes in the future.
It is impossible for one individual to fully enter into this problem and list all the causes that have had a conventional impact on the improvement of humankind. The main purpose of this book is to examine the effects of a major cause that is closely linked to the very nature of humankind, but it has also been working constantly and influentially since the beginning of society. Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to those who have dealt with this issue. The facts that prove the existence of this cause are often stated and acknowledged, but their natural and inevitable consequences are almost completely overlooked. But perhaps in such consequences, so much of the guilt and poverty, and the unequal distribution of the blessings of nature, that wise philanthropists of all ages constantly sought to correct. Can be counted.
The cause I say is the constant tendency of all living things to increase more than the nutrients provided for it.

In Malthus's consciousness [# aside from "consciousness"], the direct goal of the first edition was to overcome the ideas of Godwin and Condorsae style, and population theory was used as the basic theory. In the second and subsequent editions, the description of this basic theory itself is the subject. This can be best understood by comparing the opening sentences of the first edition and the second and subsequent editions. The beginning of the first edition is as follows.
"In recent years, unexpected big discoveries made in the natural sciences, dissemination of general knowledge due to the expansion of printing techniques, enthusiastic research and political issues that have spread to well-educated and uncultivated societies. A terrifying phenomenon on the political line that inspires new life with new energy, especially like a flame comet, or burns the awe-inspiring inhabitants of the earth. The French Revolution, all of which are both talented men, are touching on a great era of the most significant changes, to some extent the changes that should determine the future fate of mankind. I have come to squeeze my opinion.
"It is said that a big problem is now being raised, saying that human beings will accelerate and move toward infinite improvement that was previously unthinkable, or happiness and poverty. Permanently with and wondering if he was destined to move, and with all his efforts, he would still stop at an immeasurable distance from his intended goal.
"But no matter how eagerly anyone who loves humanity must expect to resolve this troublesome anxiety, and no matter what the light that a research-minded person should teach in the future, no matter what. It is regrettable that both sides of the scholars who discuss this serious issue are still isolated from each other and do not hold their hands. Their mutual debate has not received fair consideration. The problem is not concentrated and reduced to a few more [# "emphasis marks"], and even in theory it does not seem to be approaching a decision.
"The defenders of the extant have cunning conspirators to treat a group of speculative philosophers, and they praise charity and raise a fascinating, happier social state. Anyone who is willing to destroy the existing system and pursue their ambitions, or who is a violent mad philosopher and whose ridiculous speculative and non-flying absurdity pays attention to it. It's easy to think that it's not necessary.
"Those who defend the completeness of humans and society are responding with further contempt to the defenders of the existing system. That is, it has the most miserable and narrow prejudiced slaves to stigmatize it, and it only protects the harmful effects of civil society because it benefits itself. Furthermore, it is a person who buys and sells enlightenment for profit, and none of the great and noble ones have the power to grasp this, and the front five | It is not possible to accept the views of the wisdom-rich human benefactors.
"Thus, in this hostility, the path of truth has to be hardened. There are really good arguments on both sides of this issue, but they are not allowed to exert their legitimate power. Both sides take their own theories and do not try to correct or improve their own theories, paying attention to what the other side says.
"A defender of the existing order generally rejects all political speculation. He would not even retire and consider the rationale for the inference of completeness in society. It would be hard to point out the mistake fairly.
"Speculative theorists are also violating the path of truth. He is delighted to portray the state of a happier social state in the most fascinating way, paying close attention to it, and swearing at all existing systems, and he should use his talents to eliminate the harmful effects. Without thinking of the best and safest way, and even in theory, it does not seem to be aware of the terrifying obstacles that threaten human progress towards perfection.
"It is an academically accepted truth that the correct theory is always confirmed by experiment. However, in practice, there are many frictions and many subtle circumstances that are almost unpredictable to even the most knowledgeable and sharp people, so any theory that is not correct in the light of experience. However, it cannot be said that it is correct for most problems. Therefore, a theory that is not in the light of experience cannot be said to be so until it has carefully considered all the objections to it and refuted it sufficiently and consistently. It cannot be correct.
"I was very pleased to read a few discussions about the completeness of humans and society. I was excited and interested in the fascinating sights they offered. I am eager for such a happy improvement. However, on the way, I think there are big difficulties that I cannot overcome. It is my current purpose to explain this difficulty, but at the same time I am not delighted to say that it is the reason for overthrowing the advocates of leather advancement, and this difficulty is complete. It's up to me to declare here that nothing is so pleasing to me that it is excluded.
"The most important argument I'm trying to make is certainly not novel. The underlying principles are partly stated by Huum, and Dr. Adam Smith states this more broadly. Mr. Wallace also mentioned this and applied it to the current problem, but he did not give enough weight to it. And perhaps this is what many scholars I don't know say. So if this was legitimately refuted, I would argue this in a slightly different way than I've ever seen, but I'm not willing to restate it anyway. It wouldn't have been.
"It is not easy to explain why those who defend the perfection of mankind ignore this. I can't doubt the talents of people like Godwin and Condorsae. I wouldn't doubt their justice. From my point of view, this difficulty is insurmountable, but perhaps others will probably think so. However, these people, who are well-known for their talents and intellect, are advancing the path of meditation with consistent enthusiasm and conviction, with little attention to this. I certainly do not have the right to say that they are deliberately closing their eyes on such theories. Rather, it would be true for me to doubt that such an argument is true, no matter how true it seems to me, because such people are ignoring it. But in this regard, we must admit that we are all too prone to fallacy. If I see a person with a glass of wine being served many times and he doesn't look at it, I feel like thinking he's blind or rude. Must be. But a more correct theory might teach me that my eyes were doing something wrong and that what was served was not wine.
"In entering the debate, I assume that I will separate from this issue any theory, that is, assumptions that, according to the correct scholarly grounds, would not be possible. There must be. One argue may tell me that a person will eventually become an ostrich. I can't deny this nicely. But if he wants to agree with some of his thoughts, he says that mankind's neck is getting longer and longer, his lips are getting harder and bigger, and his feet are getting harder and bigger day by day. We must first prove that the shape is changing day by day and the hair is beginning to turn into feathers. And while it is not proved that such a wonderful change is really happening, "Uchi" talks that human beings will be happy if they become ostriches, and states their running ability and flying ability, and human beings are all The fact that boring luxury is no longer an issue, only the collection of daily necessities, and therefore the labor share of each person is small and the quiet time is sufficient, is certainly just a time-killing discussion. .. 』\

Dr. Franklin says that there is no limit to its fertility, except for those that result from the crowding of flora and fauna and interfering with each other's living materials. He says that if there are no other plants on the surface of the earth, then a mere kind of fennel, for example, will gradually spread and cover the whole land, and if there are no other inhabitants, it will be centuries. Then, it will be filled with only one nation, for example, British orchid people, 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing].

This is indisputably true. Throughout the animal and plant kingdom, nature has sown the seeds of life most generously and generously, but relatively spared the room and nutrients needed to feed it. The seeds of life contained in this land, if freely extended, will fill millions of worlds in thousands of years. However, the urgent universal law of nature, inevitably, suppresses it within a certain limit. Animal and plant species are atrophied under this law of great restriction, and humans cannot escape from it by any rational effort.

[Translation] This paragraph is a reprint of the first edition with some additions. 1st ed., Pp. 14-15.
In the second and subsequent editions, as shown in the two paragraphs on the right, the inequality in both population and food growth is explained immediately after raising the issue, but in the first edition, it is famous prior to this. "Public standard" (postulata) comes out. That is, following the sentence from the first edition quoted on the right, there is the following:
"I think it's okay to have two axioms.
"First, food is necessary for human survival.
"Second, the lust between the two sexes is inevitable, and will almost maintain its status quo.
"These two laws seem to have been our natural definite methods since we came to have even a little knowledge of humanity. And since we have not seen any change in this, the god who first created the order of the universe and is still doing all its various works for his creations according to the definite law. We do not have the right to conclude that these facts will be different from the present unless we directly deal with them.
"As far as I know, no one on earth thought that humans would eventually be able to live without food. But Godwin infers that the lust between the two sexes will disappear in it. But since he says that this part of the book is out of the scope of cowardice, I am now arguing that humans are just trying to prove human completeness from a state of ambiguity. Let's just say that it is best to draw from the great progress that has been made and the point at which it is hard to say where it will stop. However, until now, the lust between both sexes has not been suitable for extinction. It still seems to exist with the same power as it did 2,000 or 4,000 years ago. There are now personal exceptions, but they have always been. And since these exceptions are unlikely to increase in number, it is certainly extremely non-academic to speculate that these exceptions are the principles and the principles are the exceptions, just because there are exceptions. Reasoning.
"As my axioms have been recognized, I say that the power of population growth is indefinitely greater than the power of land to produce living materials for humans. 』\

For plants and irrational animals, the problem is simple. They are all driven by such an increase by a powerful instinct. And this instinct is not hampered by suspicions about raising its offspring. Therefore, wherever there is freedom, the increasing power is always exerted. And the excess results are later suppressed by the lack of room and nutrients.

[Translation] The last part is as follows in the second edition,-
"And the over-results are later suppressed by lack of room and nutrients, which is common to plants and animals, and in animals, by feeding each other. To. 』\
In the first edition, all the paragraphs start with the word "in plants and animals", and "suspicion about raising" is "reason or suspicion about raising", and it remains in the form of the second edition. And, with the head of this paragraph in the second and subsequent editions, the place appears far away from here. 1st ed., ch. II. Pp. 27-28. And in the next paragraph, there is nothing more than:
"For plants and animals, the result is seed waste, disease and premature death. It is poverty and guilt in humankind. The former poverty is an absolutely inevitable consequence. Guilt is a markedly probable consequence, so we see it being highly diffuse, but perhaps we should not call it an absolutely inevitable consequence. Moral blame lies in resisting any temptation to harm. 』1st ed., Pp. 15-16,
[# End of indentation here]
The impact of this hindrance on humans is more complex. Equally powerful instincts drive that kind of increase, but reason hampers it and asks him if he is creating someone who cannot afford to live. If he listens to this natural suggestion, this restraint too often produces guilt. If we do not hear this suggestion, we will be constantly trying to increase the number of human species beyond our living materials. However, because of the difficulty of obtaining food, because of our natural law of feeding and making it necessary for human life, the population can never actually increase beyond the minimum nutrients that can feed it. Strong obstacles to the resulting population must be in constant action. This difficulty must fall somewhere, and inevitably be perceived by a large part of mankind as some form of poverty or fear of poverty.

The constant tendency of the population to grow beyond living data, and the fact that it is restrained to its natural level by these causes, can be seen from the various social conditions that humankind has passed through. You will understand enough. But prior to proceeding to this overview, what would be the natural increase in man-made if it were left to work completely freely, and the production of land under the optimal circumstances of human labor. It is probably more convenient to understand this problem clearly if you try to see how much you can expect the rate of increase in things.

[Translation] The second edition follows this with the following sentence.
"Comparing these two growth rates, we can judge the power of the population's tendency to grow more than the above-mentioned living materials. 』\

The conduct is extremely chastity and simple, and the living materials are extremely abundant, so there was no hindrance to early marriage resulting from the difficulty of supporting the family, and due to bad habits, cities, unhealthy occupations and overwork, humankind It will be acknowledged that a country that has never been wasted seeds has never been known. Therefore, in any state we know, the power of the population has never been left to work completely freely.
Whether or not the law on marriage was enacted, it seems that the teaching of nature and morality is to attach to one woman earlier in the year. And if there is no obstruction of any kind to the marriage that should result from such attachment, and no subsequent cause of population decline, the increase in humanity is clearly far greater than any increase known to date.

But because we are quite certain to be within the bounds of truth, we are the slowest of these growth rates, that is, all co-existing testimonies are in agreement, and only by reproduction. Let us take one rate that has been repeatedly confirmed to be.
Therefore, I would be sure that the population will continue to double every 25 years or increase in geometric series when unimpeded.
[# Indent two characters from here]

[# End of indentation here]
It will not be so easy to determine the ratio at which land production is expected to increase. However, in this regard, one can be quite convinced that the rate of increase in a limited area must be quite different in nature from the rate of population growth. Billion people are just as easily doubled every twenty-five years by population growth as one thousand. However, food to feed the increase resulting from this higher number will never be as easily obtained as that of the smaller number. Humans are inevitably limited by room. When all the fertile land is finally occupied in addition to one Eikaa, the yearly food increase must depend on the improvement of the land already owned. This is a fund that does not increase gradually due to the nature of any soil, but gradually decreases. But the population will continue to grow, if food is given to it, without diminishing its power in any way, and the increase in one period will give more [# "emphasis mark"] greater power in the next. , Thus it will continue endlessly.
From what I wrote about China and Japan, no matter how well we turned the labor of humankind, we can wonder if the products of these countries could be doubled even once after many years. Indeed, there are many places on earth that have never been cultivated and are almost unoccupied. But even these sparsely populated rural populations have the right to extinct or starve to the corner, which can be questioned from a moral point of view. The process of advancing their spirits and guiding their work will inevitably be gradual. And during this period, the population will keep pace with the regularly increasing products, so it is unlikely that advanced knowledge and labor will immediately work on fertile unoccupied land. Even if this happens, as it sometimes happens in neocolons, this advantage will not be permanent, as the geometric series grows abnormally rapidly. If the United States continues to grow-this is certainly true, though not at the same speed as before-Indians are increasingly slaughtered into the hinterland, and eventually the entire race is extinct. , And the territory will not be able to expand any further.
[# Indent two characters from here]
[Translation] "And the territory is more ..." appears from the 5th edition.
[# End of indentation here]
The place mentioned on the right can be applied to all regions where the soil is incompletely cultivated to some extent. Extinction of the largest inhabitants of Asia and Africa is an unforgivable idea, even for a moment. Civilizing the various races of Tatars and blacks and instructing their work would certainly take a significant amount of time, and the degree and certainty of their success would be unreliable.
Europe is never densely populated to its extreme point. In Europe, human labor is most likely to receive the best guidance. Agricultural science has been extensively studied in England and Scotland. And yet these countries have vast uncultivated land. Therefore, let us consider at what rate we can imagine that our products will increase under the circumstances that are most favorable for improvement.
If it is recognized that the island nation's average production can be doubled in the first twenty-five years, by best possible policies and by great agricultural incentives, this is probably more than reasonably expected. It will allow an increase.
It is impossible to imagine that the product could be quadrupled in the next twenty-five years. This would go against all our knowledge of geology. Improving barren land would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. And for those who are aware of any agricultural problems, the increase that can be added year by year to the previous average product must be gradually, regularly and diminished in proportion to the expansion of farming. It must be clear. So, because it is difficult to compare population and food growth better [# "more"] than any experience we have about the nature of the land, without compromising accuracy. Let's take a clear process that is advantageous to the productivity of the land.
Without a decrease in the year-to-year increase added to the previous average product-which would certainly decrease-is still the same, and the production of our island nation is every twenty-five years. Let us assume that it can be increased by the same amount as the current production value. Even the largest optimists cannot assume a larger increase. Thus, in the centuries, this island nation will become like a flower garden.
[# Indent two characters from here]
[Translation] The ones that correspond to the above three paragraphs are in 1st ed., Pp. 21-22. However, the explanation about the peculiarities of agricultural production is detailed.
[# End of indentation here]
If this assumption applies to the entire planet, and if it is recognized that the human living data provided by the land can be increased by the current production value every twenty-five years, then this is every possible human endeavor. We would assume a rate of increase far beyond what we can imagine.
Therefore, given the current average state of the land, living materials could probably not be increased faster than the arithmetic progression under the circumstances most favorable to human labor. You can say that.
[# Indent two characters from here]
[Translation] This paragraph corresponds to 1st ed., P. 23.
[# End of indentation here]
The inevitable consequences of combining these two different growth rates would be extremely surprising. Let's assume that the island nation has a population of 10 million and that its current production is equivalent to easily feeding this number. In the first twenty-five years, the population will be 22 million and food will be doubled, so living data will be equal to this increase. In the next twenty-five years, the population will be 44 million, and living materials will be equivalent to feeding only 34 million. In the next period, the population will be 88 million, and living materials will feed just half of them. Thus, at the end of the first century, the population was 176 million, living materials were only enough to feed 55 million, and the population of 122 million was totally. You will not be given food.

[# End of indentation here]
If we take the whole earth instead of this island country, immigration will of course be another problem. And assuming that the current population is equal to one billion, humanity will increase to one, two, four, eight, sixteen, 32, sixty-four, one twenty-eight, two hundred fifty-six, and one living material. , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and so on. In the second century, the ratio of the population to living materials will be 256: 9, in the third century it will be 469:13, and in 2,000 years the gap will be almost uncalculable. ..
In the assumption on the right, there was no limit to the production of land. It will increase forever and will be greater than any number that can be indicated. Moreover, because the power of population growth is so predominant at all times, the growth of mankind is due to the constant action of that powerful inevitable law, which acts as a hindrance to greater power. Only can be deterred by the standards of living materials.

Chapter 2 General obstacles to the population and their working styles
From this, it can be seen that the ultimate obstacle to the population is the lack of food that inevitably arises from the difference in the rate of increase of the population and food.
Direct obstruction is unrelated to any customs and illnesses that appear to be caused by the rarity of living materials, and, although unrelated to this rarity, tends to weaken and destroy the human body ahead of time. It can be said that it is the cause of all moral and physical illnesses.
[# Indent two characters from here]
[Translation] All of the above appears from the third edition.
[# End of indentation here]
Such impediments to the population, which are constantly more or less influential in all societies and keep the population at the level of living materials, can be divided into two general categories-preventive obstruction and aggressiveness. To hinder the target.
Preventive obstruction is peculiar to human beings as long as it is voluntary (Translation 1), and is caused by the superiority characteristic of rational power that allows human beings to weigh distant results. All obstacles to the indefinite growth of plants and irrational animals are either positive or involuntary, if at all prophylactic. But when humans look around themselves and see the plight that often oppresses those with large families, they also think of their current wealth or earnings, which they are currently consuming most of their own, and most of it. When trying to calculate each person's minutes if he would probably have to divide this into seven or eight without any additions, he would follow the taste of his thoughts. I have to feel the suspicion that I can probably feed the children that I should bring to the world. If there could be something like an equal society, this would be a simple matter in such a society. But in the current social situation, other considerations arise. Will he be forced to lower his position in the world and significantly abandon his former habits? Could some work come up and reasonably hope to keep the family alive? Wouldn't he be more difficult and harder to work than he was single? Perhaps we cannot give the children the same education and progress that we have acquired. If he has a large family, can he be convinced that he can save them from stagnation and destitute poverty, and the resulting corruption in society, with all his efforts? .. And I wondered if he would be in a position of stubbornness, losing his independence and having to rely on his poorly charitable hands.
[# Indent two characters from here]
[Translation [# "Note" is missing in the original] 1] The phrase "as long as it is voluntary" appears in the third edition.
[Translation 2] This sentence is as follows in the second edition,-
"Plants and animals clearly have no doubts about the future upbringing of their offspring. Therefore, all obstacles to their indefinite increase are positive. 』\
[Translation 3] The following paragraphs and the following paragraphs are transcripts from 1st ed., P. 28.

Only if such consideration is taken will many of all civilized nations seem and certainly not be subject to the natural life of being attached to a woman (). Translation).

"And this restraint almost inevitably produces guilt, if not absolutely. But in all societies, even the most guilty ones, there is a strong tendency towards moral cohesion, and therefore there is constant effort towards population growth. This constant effort, likewise, tends to put the lower classes of society in distress and prevent any permanent improvement in their circumstances. 』\
[# End of indentation here]
If this restraint does not produce guilt, this is undoubtedly the least harm that can arise from the principle of population. It must be admitted that it causes some temporary misery, given the restraint on a strong natural propensity, but it is clearly a minor misfortune compared to any of the harms that result from any of the other obstacles to the population. Yes, and the constant duty of moral factors, the sacrifice of temporary satisfaction for permanent satisfaction, is of the same nature as many others.

Others There are some terminological corrections in the third edition and below.
[# End of indentation here]
When this suppression creates guilt, the harm that accompanies it is too prominent. Orgy that hinders the birth of a child most clearly seems to reduce the dignity of humanity. It certainly affects boys, but nothing else is more obvious than its tendency to corrupt a woman's personality and destroy all its adorable feminine traits. In addition to this, with that of the unfortunate woman, who is abundant in every big city, there is probably greater real misery and greater poverty than any other sector of life. become.
When general corruption of sexual morality pervades all social classes, the consequences inevitably undermine the source of family well-being, weaken the affection of couples and parents, and parents care for and educate their children together. Effort and enthusiasm must be diminished, with such consequences always accompanied by a decisive diminution of the general well-being and morality of society, especially for private communication and for concealing its consequences. However, the need for tactics is inevitably leading to many other sins [# "o" is "o" in the bottom line].
Positive impediments to the population are extremely diverse and include all causes that, to some extent, help shorten human life, whether due to guilt or poverty. Therefore, under this category are all unhealthy occupations, hard work and exposure to cold and heat, extreme poverty, poor child care, big cities, all kinds of incontinence, all common illnesses and infectious diseases, war. , Epidemic, and famine could be mentioned.
Examining these obstacles to population growth, which I have classified under the categories of preventive and positive obstruction, will find that they all result in moral restraint, guilt, and poverty.
The restraint of marriage without abnormal satisfaction in the preventive hindrance could be legitimately named moral restraint 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing].
[# Indent two characters from here]
1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko] You can see that I use the word moral [# "moral" as an emphasis mark] in its most limited meaning. Moral restraint is a modestly motivated restraint of marriage and should be understood to mean strict moral conduct during this restraint. And I have never consciously left this meaning. When I think of marriage restraint that has nothing to do with the consequences, I call it modest restraint, or part of preventive restraint-certainly this is the main part of preventive restraint. -I'm calling it.
While looking at various social stages, I was attacked by saying that I did not recognize the importance of moral restraint in preventing the population. But if you look at the limited meaning of this word as mentioned here, you can see that I haven't made a big mistake in this regard. I'm very happy if I'm wrong.

Orgy, unnatural lust, blasphemy of the marriage bed, and unjustified measures to conceal the consequences of private communication are clearly preventative obstacles that belong to the category of sin.
Among the positive obstacles, what seems to occur inevitably from the laws of nature can be called poverty. And what we have apparently invited ourselves, such as war, incontinence, and many others that we can avoid, have a mixed nature. It is brought about by guilt, and the result is poverty 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing, "1" is missing in the bottom line].

1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko] The general result of guilt is poverty, and this result is the exact reason why an act is called guilt, so the word poverty is sufficient here. You might think that using both is superfluous. But rejecting the word guilt would cause great confusion between our words and ideas. We, in particular, the acts whose general tendencies create poverty and are therefore forbidden by the lives of the Creator and the discipline of moralists-most in its direct or personal consequences, it is probably the exact opposite. I want to make a distinction between what it will produce. Satisfaction of all our lusts is happy in its immediate consequences, not poverty. And in the personal case, even its distant consequences (at least in this world) probably belong to the same name. There may have been a private affair with a woman who increased the well-being of both parties and did not harm anyone. Therefore, such personal behavior cannot belong to the category of poverty. But the fear is still guilty, because the act of breaking the obvious discipline is so named because it has a general tendency to create poverty, whatever its personal consequences. And no one can doubt the general tendency of bisexual adultery to undermine social well-being.

The sum of all these preventive and positive obstacles is a direct obstacle to the population. And in every country where full fertility is not allowed, it is clear that preventive and positive disturbances must move in inverse proportion. In other words, no matter what the cause, in countries that are naturally unhealthy or have major deaths, preventive obstruction will be rare. Conversely, in countries that are naturally healthy and where prophylactic obstruction is seen to work with great force, positive obstruction is rare or deaths will be very small.

In every country, these obstacles are constantly working, regardless of their power. However, despite its widespread use, few countries are free from constant efforts by the population to grow beyond living data. This constant effort, likewise, tends to put the lower classes of society in poverty and prevent some permanent major improvement in their circumstances.

The result seems to be produced as follows in the current state of society. Let us assume that the living materials of a country are just as easy to feed its inhabitants. Constant efforts to increase the population, which can be seen to be working even in the most sinful societies, will increase the population before the number of living materials increases. Therefore, the food that previously nourished 10 million must now be divided into 11.5 million. The lives of the poor must be worse as a result, and many must fall into extreme poverty. Labor prices should tend to fall, while food prices will rise at the same time, as the number of workers will also be more than proportional to the work in the market. Therefore, workers have to do more work [# "more" sidelines] to earn as much as they did before. In this distress, the hindrance to marriage and the difficulty of supporting the family will be so great that population growth will be delayed. However, the low cost of labor and the abundance of workers and the need for them to increase their labor encourage cultivators to open new lands and make cultivated lands more [# "emphasis marks"] completely fertilized. In order to improve and improve, more labor will be put into the land [# "emphasis mark"], and thus the living materials will finally be proportional to the population in the same proportion as the time of the starting point. Workers' conditions will be much better at this time, and some restraint on the population will be relaxed. And after a short period of time, the same movement of backward and forward movements regarding happiness is repeated.

This kind of movement is probably not clearly visible to the average person. And even the most careful observers will find it difficult to time. But in most of the ancient nations, the existence of this kind of alternation movement, which is far more obscure and irregular than I have mentioned here, is often seen by thoughtful people who ponder this issue in depth. There is no doubt about it.
One major reason why this movement has not been described so far, as expected, and has not been so clearly confirmed by experience, is that the history of humankind we own is generally merely the upper class. Because it is the history of. We do not have many reliable descriptions of the behaviors and habits of the part of humankind where such backward and forward movements mainly occur. In order to create this kind of satisfying history for one nation, one era, many careful observers, with constant utmost care, relate to the state of the lower classes of society and the causes that influenced it. , It will be necessary to make a local and general description. And in order to draw an accurate reasoning on this issue, it would be necessary for such a historian to continue for centuries. Statistical knowledge in this area has been dealt with in some countries in recent years 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. And we can expect that the progress of such research will lead to a clearer understanding of the internal structure of human society. But this science is still in its childhood, and many of the subjects for which it is desirable to gain knowledge are either unaddressed or not stated accurately enough. What can be counted as such is the proportion of the number of adults to the number of marriages, the extent to which bad habits are widespread as a result of restraint of marriage, the children of the most deprived parts of society and the children of those who live more comfortably. Mortality comparisons with, true working class fluctuations, visible differences in the circumstances of the lower classes of society regarding ease and happiness at different times of the period, and the most important of these issues.

If there is a loyal history that includes such details, it tends to greatly reveal how constant obstruction to the population works, and perhaps proves the existence of the above-mentioned reversal movement. Let's go. However, the timing of the vibration is inevitably irregular due to many intervening causes. Such causes include, for example, the rise or fall of an industry, the spread of the corporate spirit of agriculture, the fertility of the year, the war, the epidemic, poor law, immigration, and other causes of similar nature. ..
Probably the most contributing factor in keeping this movement out of the eyes of ordinary people is the difference between the nominal price and the true price of labor. It is extremely rare for the nominal price of labor to fall universally. However, we are well aware of the cases where the nominal prices of food are gradually rising and the nominal prices of labor are often still the same. This is generally the case when the increase in commerce and industry is sufficient to hire new workers to be put into the market and prevent the increase in supply from lowering money prices. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. However, an increase in the number of workers receiving the same monetary wages will inevitably lead to a rise in the monetary price of grains due to the competition. This is effectively a real fall in the price of labor, and during this period the conditions of the lower classes of society must gradually deteriorate. But farmers and capitalists are rich in the truth of labor. As their capital increases, they will be able to hire more people. And since the population has probably suffered some hindrance due to the increasing difficulty of feeding the family, the demand for labor will increase in proportion to the supply after a period of time, and its price will be its natural. Of course, if it is left to return to the standard, it will rise. Thus, the wages of labor, and thus also the circumstances of the lower classes of society, will be a reversal movement, even if labor prices do not fall nominally at all. ).

1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko] If new workers who are put into the market year by year find no employment opportunities other than agriculture, their competition will lower the monetary price of labor, This will prevent population growth from bringing about more effective demand for more than [# "tate-chu"] grains. In other words, if landowners and farmers only get additional agricultural labor in exchange for additional products they can produce, they will not attempt to produce it.

This is effectively a real fall in the price of labor, and during this period the conditions of the lower classes of society must gradually worsen. But farmers and capitalists are rich in the truth of labor. His increase in capital will allow him to hire more people than before. Therefore, there will be more work, and as a result, the price of labor will rise. But the lack of freedom in the labor market, more or less in every society, either because of canon law, or because of the more common cause that the rich are easy to unite but the poor are difficult to do so. Labor prices will not rise at the right time, until the year of bad harvest has probably occurred, the screams have become too loud and the need has become too clear and can no longer be resisted. Moreover, it remains low for some time.
"Thus, the cause of the rising labor price is hidden. And the rich man argues that it was the pity and grace that allowed him to rise in consideration of the bad harvest. And the most unreasonable complaint that the price will not fall again when the year of a good harvest comes again. But if they think about it, they will find that it would have had to have risen long ago without their own fraudulent plots.

There is almost no doubt that a similar movement has occurred in a murky society where there is no regular labor price. When the population grows almost to the limit of food, all preventative and positive obstructions naturally increase its working power. Bad habits about sexuality will become more common, abandonment of children will increase in frequency, and opportunities and tragedy of war and infectious diseases will increase significantly. And these causes will probably continue to work until the population drops below food levels. And then, as food becomes relatively abundant, population growth will begin again, and after a period of time, growth above that [# "tate-chu"] will again be hampered by the same cause 1).

Since it will be reproduced in Chapter 6, this will be left there, and comparisons with respect to other individual sentences will be accompanied by a translation in each relevant place. The ones on the right in the first edition are as follows:

"From the above overview, or rather from the references that can be made to the hunting people, we cannot reason as follows: their population is sparse due to lack of food. Yes, if food is more abundant, it should increase immediately, and in the savage, poverty, apart from sin, compresses the predominant population growth force and equates the result to living material. It's a hindrance. With a few local temporary exceptions, the fact that this impediment is now constantly working for all savage peoples is what real observations and experiences tell us, and the theory is that This indicates that 1000 years ago, it will work with almost the same power as it does now, and that it will be about the same 1000 years later. 』\

Mr. Collins' description of this human being is, I think, giving a satisfactory answer to some extent. According to it, their height is generally not high and their bodies are not solid. Their arms, shins and thighs are stubborn because of their poor lifestyle. Those who live on the coast are relieved to find rather large maggots in the trunks of small rubber trees, rather than relying on fish as food. Due to the very small number of animals in the forest and the enormous amount of labor required to catch them, the natives of the hinterland are as poor as those on the coast. They are forced to climb very tall trees in search of small animals such as nectar, flying squirrels and kangaroos. When the trunk is very tall and has no branches-as is customary in jungles-this is a very painstaking task, holding a tree in your left hand and knurling it step by step with its stone ax. And climb.

In a land where there is no choice but to rely on such food, the food supply of animals and plants is so scarce, and the labor to obtain it is so difficult, unless the population is very thinly scattered compared to the area. It is clear that this is not the case. Its maximum must be very narrow. But when we look carefully at the strange and barbaric customs of these people, their cruel treatment of girls, and the difficulty of feeding their children, it is less likely that their population will break through this limit. Rather than being particularly suspicious, it is tempting to think that even such poor resources are more than enough to feed all the population that can grow under such circumstances.
The overture of love in this country is violence and extremely cruel violence. Barbarians choose their wives from different races, generally from races that are hostile to their race.

The husband's treatment of one or more wives seems to be similar in nature to this bizarre barbaric suitor style.

Some of these unfortunate women have countless scars all over their pruned heads.

Women treated in this way are often forced to miscarriage, and perhaps, as mentioned earlier, the insults of very young girls are common, and the union of both sexes is common. If done too early, female fertility will be diminished. Polygamy is more common than polygamy, but surprisingly, Collins can't remember more than once if he has more than one child.

It is unlikely that the first wife will have absolute exclusivity for the marital relationship. But it is possible that the second wife is not allowed to raise the child.

If the baby's mother dies, this unreliable toddler will be buried alive in the same grave as the mother. When the father himself puts a living child on the corpse of his mother and throws a large stone at it, other natives quickly fill the grave. A native named Korebe, well known to our immigrants, did this horrific act, but when he was asked about it, he could not find a woman raising this child anywhere, so thus He excused the act, saying that if he did not give him death, he would have to die worse. Collins says that there is a reason to believe that this practice is commonplace, and that it may be a reason for the sparse population to some extent. 1) [# "1)" Tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing, "1" is missing in the base].

Such habits, by themselves, probably do not have a significant impact on the population of a country, but are a good indication that it will be extremely difficult to raise a child in the life of a human being. A woman whose lifestyle constantly changes her residence and who is constantly struggling for her husband seems to never be able to raise a few children of about the same age. If the older child were to have another child before he could stand alone and walk to his mother, one of the two would almost inevitably die without being taken care of. In such a wandering and painful life, raising this for even one child must be a very daunting and painful task, so a woman who is not struck by the strong emotions of her mother What is impossible to undertake is not surprising.
In addition to these causes of forcibly suppressing the born human beings, we must still list the causes that contribute to killing them in the results. That is, the frequent wars with other races of these sick people and the constant struggle between them, the mysterious revenge that encourages late-night murder and often causes the bloodshed of innocent, ugly.

Chapter 4 About the obstacles to the population in American Indians
Next, let's turn our attention to the vast Americas. Most of the land is inhabited by small, independent tribes, who live on natural produce, much like the natives of New Holland. The land is almost entirely covered with forests, with few growing fruits and edible plants in the South Sea Islands. The amount of product produced by the extremely crude and incomplete farming known to some hunting races is so small that it can be considered as a supplement to the food caught by hunting. Therefore, it can be considered that the inhabitants of this New World live mainly by hunting and fishing. And it goes without saying that the limits for such a lifestyle are small. The food available from fishing was only available to those near lakes, rivers and the sea. And because of the unscrupulous ignorance and laziness of the unscrupulous, it was often not possible to save these foods for later than when they were actually obtained. It is often stated and acknowledged that a vast area is needed to feed this hunter. 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing]. The number of beasts they can reach, as well as the difficulty of killing or catching them, must inevitably limit the population of society. So hunting peoples will be extremely sparsely scattered on the land, as are the beasts they are similar to in their lifestyle. Like beasts, they must either drive away all enemies and escape from them, and they must contend with each other without interruption. 3) [# "3)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right small Write].

Under such circumstances, the fact that the population of the United States is extremely thin in proportion to its area is only an example of the clear truth that the population cannot increase without the food to feed it. But one of the interesting things I'm particularly interested in in this question is how the population is deterred to this scarce level of supply. The lack of food supply to the people does not always manifest itself in the form of famine, but in other, more permanent forms of distress, the habit of working harder to hinder the population before birth than to kill it from birth. It cannot be overlooked that it appears in the form of creation.
It is generally said that American women are not prolific 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. Some say that this low fertility stems from one of the characteristics that is believed to be peculiar to American enthusiasts, the lack of a man's passion for the woman. However, it is not unique to this race alone, it is probably present to a large extent in all barbarians, whose food is poor and inadequate, and who live in constant famine or anxiety struck by foreign enemies. It is what you are doing. Bruus often pays attention to this, and in particular mentions the Gala and Shangara tribes, who are the remote ethnic groups of Abyssinia. In addition, Vaiyan cites his cold temperament as the main cause of the population sparseness of the Hottentot tribe. This seems to be caused by the difficulties and dangers of a sullen life that draws attention from sexual arousal. And the main cause of the lack of passion of American natives is not the absolute flaws that come from their constitution, but the fact that such circumstances are the cause is almost proportional to the extent to which such causes are alleviated or eliminated. It seems likely as the trend diminishes. The lust between the two sexes is even more enthusiastic in the regions of the United States where the hardships of life are not so intense due to the special advantages of the land or further improvement. Women are more respected and valued among races that occupy riverbanks and have ample fish storage, or that live in regions that are rich in birds and beasts or where agriculture is highly advanced. And since there is almost no restraint on the satisfaction of lust, the disturbance of the customs "Binran" sometimes reaches excessively 4) [# "4)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing] (translation) ..

By the way, if we don't think of this lack of passion of American natives as a natural flaw in their body, but because it's just a general coldness and little lust urge, we Will not give much weight to it as it affects the number of children per family. Rather, it will be tempting to seek the cause of this low birth rate in the circumstances and habits of girls in a state of dismay. And thus we will find a sufficient explanation to explain the facts in question.
Robatson correctly stated as follows. "Whether boys have been improved by advances in technology and civilization is a question that has been argued among philosophers.

The predominant principle of self-preservation is so closely linked in the minds of the souls to the security and power of the society to which they belong, that it is a war honor as seen among the more open people. I do not allow the idea of ​​courage at all. It is an honor for Americans to escape from the enemies he is watching and to avoid struggles that must endanger his own body and thus his organization.

This tactic is apparently the result of being aware of the difficulties associated with raising young people under the difficulties and dangers of a confused life. And the cause of the mighty destruction would be, in some cases, large enough to keep the population much lower than the living material. But the fact that Americans are afraid of the shrinking of their society and that they have a clear desire to expand it is generally not proof that the facts are true. A country that is in conflict with each other probably cannot feed an increasing population, and the increasing power of the tribe, on the other hand, provides a new source of new sources of living material from its relatively weakened enemies. .. And, on the contrary, the decrease in the number of members will cause extinction and famine due to the invasion of stronger races, rather than feeding the remaining members more abundantly than before. It is.
Originally just a small part of the Guarani tribe, the Siriguanne tribe left their homeland of Paraguay and settled in the mountains near Peru. They found enough living material in this new country, rapidly increasing, attacking the neighborhood, and gradually extinct it with great courage and good fortune, and robbed it of its land.

And, almost without exception, the population is squeezing this more closely than it is, as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of poverty from food shortages in all parts of the United States.
According to Dr. Robatson, there have been prominent cases of the dire situation that barbaric people suffer from famine. As one of them, he wrote a statement by Alvar Nuunes Cabesa de Vaca, one of the Spanish explorers who lived for almost nine years among Florida enthusiasts. He said that this man is unaware of all kinds of agriculture and lives mainly on the roots of various plants, but it is very difficult to obtain this and he asks for it and wanders around.

The extremely unusual population decline that occurred between Native Americans may seem to some to be inconsistent with the theory that they are trying to establish here. But all the causes of this rapid decline will be attributed to the three major obstacles to the population mentioned above. It is argued that these obstacles, under special circumstances, act with extraordinary forces, but in some cases may not be stronger than the principle of population growth. It is not.
Indians' insatiable love for alcoholic beverages is 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing], according to Charlevoix, 2) [# " 2) ”is a tate-chu-yoko, line-right essay], which constantly causes a fatal struggle between them, and a new line of illness that cannot be fought because of their lifestyle. Since it exposes them and kills their fertility in its very source, it can be considered a sin sufficient to produce the current population decline. In addition to this, almost everywhere, Indian contact with Europeans discourages Indians, weakens or misdirects their work, and consequently reduces the source of living materials. You have to think about the tendency. In Santo Domingo, the Indians deliberately abandoned the cultivation of the land in order to starve its cruel oppressors 3) [# "3)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right. In Peru and Chilei, forced labor of natives was a fatal conversion to underground digging rather than ground cultivation. And in the northern races, the extreme desire to buy European alcoholic beverages has led the labor of most of them to be directed towards increased yields just in exchange for this 4) [# "4)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-handed], and as a result, their attention is not directed to the source of more harvested living materials [# to "yori"], and at the same time, hunting products are also produced. It would have tended to destroy rapidly. The number of wild beasts in all known regions of the United States has decreased more than the number of humans 5) [# "5)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-handed]. Agricultural attention has diminished everywhere, rather than increasing as initially expected from contact with Europeans. I haven't heard of any Indians in any of South America or North America, whose numbers have declined and have become very prosperous. Thus, even now, despite all the possible causes of destruction mentioned above, the average population of Americans is, with few exceptions, equal to the average amount of food they can obtain in their current working conditions. That said, there would be no big mistake.

Chapter 5: Obstacles to the population in the South Sea Islands
Monk Reinal talked about the ancient state of the British Isles and the islanders in general, saying, "We see in these people the origins of the myriad of strange institutions that drive population growth. These include cannibalism, castration of boys, blockade of female genital mutilation, late marriage, consecration of virgins, praise of singles, and punishment for girls who are too young to be mothers. , Line right writing]. He says that such habits caused by overpopulation on the islands have been brought to the continent, and continental scholars are still trying to find out why. The priest says that the American savage tribe surrounded by enemies and the open, densely populated people who are surrounded by other nations and in the same position are in many ways similar to the islanders. , Seems unaware. On the continent, as much as the islands, the barriers to population growth above [# "emphasis mark"] are not clearly defined and are not visible to ordinary observers, but they are almost overcome. It is a difficult obstacle. And even those who leave the country and move to a foreign country because they cannot put up with the plight in their own country are not always saved there. Perhaps no country is yet known that production can no longer be increased. This is all that can be said about the whole planet. Both continents and islands are populated to the point of their actual products. And the whole planet is similar to the islands in this respect. However, the population limits of islands are extremely narrow and clear, especially when their area is small, and anyone must see and approve of this, so there is the most reliable record of impediments to the island's population. The study will have a tendency to very well illustrate the current problem. The question asked in Captain Cook's First Voyage about the sparsely scattered swordsmen of New Holland: "In any way, the inhabitants of this country are in the number they can feed. Is it reduced? 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing], "is equally justified for the most densely populated islands in the South Sea, or for the most populous countries in Europe and Asia.

And perhaps the desire to take part in a human flesh treat is also a considerable stimulus. … The way they carry out their terrifying plans is to secretly attack the enemy during the night. And if they see their enemies neglected (but believe this is rare), they kill everything indiscriminately, not to be missed by women and children. At the end of the murder, they either eat at a feast on the spot, or carry away as many corpses as possible and eat them at home in an indescribably brutal way. ... There is no military law to save lives or take prisoners of war, so losers have no choice but to escape. This constant state of war and destructive combat methods have a very powerful effect on creating habitual vigilance, so the New Jiland natives dismiss the vigilance, day or night.

What is said on the right is in the last voyage, in which the mistakes in the previous description would have been corrected, and here the constant state of war is the main force against the population of New Jiland. There is no need to add to this issue here as it is done to the extent that it can be considered a hindrance. We have no idea if there are any habits among girls that are inconvenient for population growth. If such a thing is known, it will probably not be done outside of great distress. This is because the Kedashi tribes will, of course, rarely seek to increase their population in order to increase their offensive and defensive power. However, the wandering life of women in the South Sea Islands and the constant crisis force them to constantly arm themselves to travel and work. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right.

However, although the hindrance to such a population is strong, it can be seen that it rarely lowers the population below the average living data, judging from the fact that the season of deficiency rises.

If you turn your eyes to the densely populated coastal areas of Outaheit and the Society Islands from the sparsely scattered inhabitants of New Jiland, a different sight will be developed. From a country that is said to be fertile, such as the Hesperides Garden, all anxieties of deficiency seem to have disappeared. .. However, this first impression turns out to be wrong immediately after a little rethinking. Happiness and wealth are always considered to be the most promising causes of population growth. In a pleasant climate, with few illnesses, and where women do not suffer any harsh labor, why would these causes not work with unparalleled power in less fortunate regions? Is it? But if these causes worked, where could this population find room and food within such narrow and limited limits? If the population of Otaheit, which has no surroundings of 40 rigs, has risen to 24,000 and surprised Captain Cook, 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing], Assuming that the population will be doubled every 25 years after a century, if it reaches more than 3 million, where should we dispose of it? 3) [# "3)" is tate-chu-yoko, line Right writing].

With its current product, Kedashi Otaheit has only a hundred humans, the same number of men and women, and if one boy protects one girl, the population will continue to grow for six or seven generations. Is unprecedented, and I have to think that it should probably be doubled in less than 15 years.

The difficult situation here is compressed to a very narrow range, and it is extremely clear, reliable and powerful, so we cannot escape from it. This is unacceptable in everyday warm-hearted ways, such as discussing immigrants or more [# "more" emphasis] or more cultivating. In this case, we have to admit that the former is impossible and the latter is clearly inappropriate. It is absolutely true that this group of islands cannot continue to double their population every twenty-five years. Therefore, we can trace some extremely powerful obstacles to the population in the habits of the people, unless constant miracles make girls unscrupulous, without going into the study of social conditions there. You should be confident that it will be.
According to the numerous reports we have received regarding Outaheit and its neighboring islands, Airi Ioi 1) [# "1)", which caused such a great surprise among civilized nations, is tate-chu-chu.

Although no special system of the same nature is found in the lower societies, the most prominent feature of guilt is just too widespread. Child killing is not limited to Airi Ioi. It is forgiven for all. And because it's so widespread among the upper classes that it has led to the elimination of all infamy, the scorn of poverty, perhaps it's often adopted as a fad rather than a necessary measure, and ok. And it seems that it is done without any hesitation.
It is very correct that Huum says that the acceptance of child killing generally contributes to the population growth of a country 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-handed]. It encourages marriage because it eliminates the fear of having too many families. What's more, parents can't rely on such a cruel method except in extreme cases because of their strong love.

The widespread evacuation and orgy among the lower class people, which may be exaggerated in some cases, is largely revealed by unquestionable evidence. Captain Cook made a clear effort to save the Otaheit woman from too common fornication, in which he had more such sexual activity on the island than in any other country.

A normal marriage in Otaheit has no ritual other than giving a gift from a man to his daughter's parents. And this seems to be a deal with parents for permission to try their daughter, rather than an absolute contract with their wife. If the father thinks he hasn't paid enough for his daughter, he doesn't hesitate to let his daughter break up with the man and live with a more generous man. A man is free to get a new wife at any time. If his wife is pregnant, he kills the child and then continues to have a relationship with his mother or leaves her, as he likes. Only when he picks up the child and takes care of it is considered to be married. But then a younger wife may join the outside of the first wife. However, it is much more common for relationships to change more than this, and it is a daily routine to talk about this without hesitation. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right small writing].

It will be found that the hindrance to the population due to such social conditions is sufficient to offset the consequences of the most favorable climate and the most abundant food.

Thus, it turns out that the major obstacles to population growth are the three guilts of orgy, murder, and war, but each of them works with great power. However, no matter how powerful these causes are in preventing and destroying life, they have not always kept the population at the level of living data. According to Anderson, "Despite the extreme fertility of the island, famine often occurs, with many dying. Whether this is due to unseasonable seasons, overpopulation (although it must happen almost inevitably at times), or war, I still can't determine this. The truth of the matter is that they use it very humblely even when food is abundant, so it can be fully inferred. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right essay ].

According to Anderson, animal food is only available in very small quantities in the lower classes, and even that is fish or other seafood. Because they eat little or no pork.

Perhaps Captain Cook overestimated the population of Otaheit, and perhaps the evangelists overestimated it, based on the underlying material of the calculation. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko , Line right writing]. But I do not doubt that the population has declined significantly since Captain Cook's visit, given the different descriptions of people's economic customs in different times. Captain Cook and Anderson agree that they are very careful about all kinds of food. Anderson clearly states that famines occur frequently after a very close investigation in this regard.

According to these statements, it can be seen that the population of Otaheit Island is currently being squeezed significantly below the average living data, but it is premature to conclude that this will continue for a long time in the future. The changes in the state of the island, which Captain Cook admitted on his frequent visits, seem to prove that there is a significant upheaval in its prosperity and population 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu.

We can imagine that the population of any of these islands had stopped at a certain number for a long time in the past, or could have increased regularly at some rate, no matter how gradual. Absent. There must have been a big change. Overpopulation will always increase the innate war habits of the human beings.

And the cause of these population declines will also continue to work at an accelerating rate for some time after the circumstances that exacerbated them have ended. Some gradual changes in habits caused by changing circumstances will soon restore the population to its former state, and this population will not be able to remain at its natural level for a long time without the most violent violence. Only experience can determine how contact with the Europeans worked in Outhaheit with this most violent violence and prevented it from reverting to its former population. But if this is the case, I do not doubt that if we trace the cause, we will find it to be a weight of guilt and poverty.

Regarding other islands in the Pacific Ocean, we do not have as much knowledge as Otaheit. But with our knowledge alone, we can be confident that the social conditions in all of its major archipelago are remarkably similar in many respects.

In the Friendly Islands, the king's power is infinite and the people's life property is said to be at their disposal, but there are other chiefs who act like small sovereigns. The king often scorned it because it interfered with the king's way of doing things. "But how" (as Captain Cook says) "Although this influential person is independent of the king's tyrannical power, we are at the mercy of the lower class people, each of whom belongs to the chief.

We couldn't elaborate on the customs because only a few other islands were visited and therefore the description about them was inadequate.

And from the evangelism voyage, we can see that in the season when bread is not fruitful, everything suffers from temporary deficiency.

These facts, no matter how abundant the products of these islands are found at some point in time, or how they are hindered by ignorance, war and other causes, their average population is general. In short, it is a powerful proof that it is tightly pushing the limits of average food. It is clear that we are extremely vulnerable to superficial wealth in social conditions where the lives of the lower class people appear to be of little or no value to the upper class. .. And while we could easily have exchanged many pigs and edible wild plants for European goods, the main owners could easily say that their servants and slaves were extremely deficient. Can be thought of.
In ending this overview of the human social sector, which has been categorized in the name of civilized life, the only thing I can admit in its superiority to civilized life is that the masses are more [# Emphasis mark on "more"] I cannot help saying that it is a point that has a great deal of leisure time. There is less work to be done [# "emphasis mark"], and therefore less labor [# "emphasis mark"]. Given that the lower classes of civilized society are destined for constant labor, this must be seen as a significant advantage to us. But it is probably far more than offset by a great disadvantage. Extremely oppressive class discrimination occurs in all these regions where living materials are easily available. Property blows and infringements seem natural, and the lower class people are in much lower enslavement than is known in the civilized sphere. In the part where the middle equality of the vain life is carried out to a large extent, the difficulty of obtaining food and the struggle of constant war are as much labor as the labor of the lower class people of civilized society. Sure, though the labor is much more unequal in civilized society.
However, although we can compare the labor of these two classes of human society, their suffering and suffering will not allow comparison. What makes this point most clear seems to me to be the whole policy of education in the lower races of the American savage. Everything that helps teach the strongest patience under the greatest pain and misery, everything that tends to stiffen the mind and point to any source of compassion, is most enthusiastically taught to the soulmate. It is a place. Civilized people, on the other hand, may be taught to endure it with patience when harm occurs, but they are not always taught to anticipate it. In addition to Tsuyoshi, other virtues are still required. In distress, he promotes and expands his social emotions to sympathize with his neighbors, or even his enemies, and, generally speaking, to expand the realm of pleasant emotions. Is taught. What can be clearly inferred from these two different teaching methods is that civilized people want to have fun and humans only expect to suffer.
Insane Spartan training and the absorption of private feelings into public interest are the people who are exposed to constant hardship and hardship from the constant war, and the constant reversal of circumstances. It could never have existed unless it was under fear. I do not consider such a phenomenon to indicate a particular tendency of spartan temperament to stubbornness and patriotism, but merely to the disastrous and almost obscure state of Sparta and, in general, Greece at the time. I want to think of it as a powerful instruction. Like the commodities on the market, the most in-demand virtues will be produced in the most multiples. And when patience under pain and suffering and excessive patriotic sacrifice are most demanded, it is a depressing instruction that indicates the poverty of the people and the insecurity of the state.

Chapter 6 About the obstacles to the population of ancient residents in northern Europe
The history of humanity's early migration and settlement, as well as the motives that prompted it, will very significantly illustrate the constant tendency of humankind to increase beyond living materials. Without some general law of this nature, it would seem that humans would never have lived in the world. It seems that the state of laziness, not the state of busy activity, is clearly the natural state of human beings. And this rushing activity orientation would not have been possible without the strong stimulus of necessity. However, it may have been sustained later by customs, new coalitions created from it, enterprising spirits, and military lust.
According to the story, Abraham and Lotto had abundant livestock, so the land could not keep them in the club. There was a dispute between their shepherds.

This simple word and proposal is the burning desert of Asia and Africa, spreading humans all over the globe and, as time goes on, overwhelming some of the relatively unlucky inhabitants of the planet with irresistible pressure. It also brilliantly illustrates the outbreak of activity in the frozen regions of Siberia and North Africa, where they were forced to seek scarce living materials. The first migration would, of course, find no obstacles other than the nature of the land. But when most of the earth became inhabited, albeit lean, the owners of these regions would not have given it up without struggle. And the excess inhabitants of any of the relatively central areas could not find room for themselves without expelling their closest neighbors or at least passing through their territory. It would inevitably have caused frequent struggles.

[Translation] The paragraph following the first edition sentence quoted in the translation of Chapter 3 is as follows:
"I don't know much more about the behaviors and customs that take place between the herders, the next state of mankind, than the state of ambiguity. But Europe and all civilized nations in the world fully explain that these peoples were not immune to the general fate of poverty resulting from the lack of living materials. Those who drove the nomads of Squitia to abandon their birthplace, like the many starving wolfs asking for food, were nothing but deficiencies. Driven by this powerful cause, barbarians such as Unkasumi gather from all parts of the Northern Hemisphere. I saw it. As they progressed, they gathered new darkness and horror, and the hordes finally covered the Italian sun and sank the whole world into eternal darkness. This terrifying consequence, which civilized nations around the world have suffered so seriously for so long and so long, will be traced to the simple cause of the superiority of population growth over living materials. 』\

Europe and the mid-latitudes of Asia appear to have been occupied by pastoralists early in history. In his opinion, Tsukidides said that in his time, European and Asian civilizations could not resist the combined Squitians. However, pastoral nations cannot support as many inhabitants as agricultural nations. But what makes the herders so terrifying is that they have the power to move as a group and often have to exert this power to find new ranches in their herds. It means that there is no. Races with abundant livestock are abundant in immediate food. Even parent livestock can be eaten when absolutely necessary. Women live more comfortably than hunting peoples and are therefore more prolific. The man probably feels little family support concern, as he believes that he can gain strength and reassurance, and that he can feed the livestock in different locations. Together, these causes will soon result in their natural and unchanging consequences of population growth. More frequent and rapid location changes are needed. Larger and more extensive land is occupied in sequence. More [# "emphasis mark"] A vast devastation spreads around them.

Driven by the present poverty, shining brighter hopes for the future, and driven by a daring enterprising spirit, these brave adventurers are for everyone who opposes them. It tends to be a terrifying enemy. Residents of long-established nations engaged in peaceful commerce and agriculture would often have been unable to resist the human power motivated by such influential actions. And the frequent struggles with races in the same circumstances as them are all struggles for survival, thus urging remorse that the punishment for defeat is death and the award for victory is life. It must have been fought with deadly courage.
Many races must have been completely extinct in such a vague struggle. Many were probably killed in distress and famine. But the other races, where the leaders gave better guidance, became large and influential races, and sent out new adventurers themselves seeking another place to live. These things would have initially been an order to the parent's race. But soon the ties that tied them were almost gone, and according to their power, their ambitions, or their convenience, they continued their friendships or became enemies.
The enormous waste of life caused by this constant struggle for room and food would have been more than compensated for by the powerful population growth that is being exercised to some extent by constant migration habits. .. The general desire to improve the situation by changing places, the constant expectation of looting, and the ability to sell the child to slaves in case of distress, combined with the barbarian's inadvertent birth.

The reigns of the weak Decius, Gallienus, Emilianus, Valerian, and Gallienus provided such a path and, as a result, suffered the general invasion of barbarians. The Gooto tribe, believed to have emigrated from Scandinavia to Yujin in a few years, agreed to withdraw their victorious army by paying tribute each year. But as soon as the dangerous secrets of the wealth and weaknesses of the Roma Empire were exposed to the world, a new group of barbarians immediately spread their hands of devastation to the remote regions and even the entrance to Roma. 3) [# "3)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing].

He says that the hordes of barbarians who once pushed out from the north are no longer there today.

How could these gathered peoples maintain themselves in such barren land for as long as the Roma Empire's prosperity, unless there was some mysterious way to obtain food?

The real cause of stopping the continued movement from the north is the fact that it is no longer possible to invade Europe's most desirable countries. It was home to the most brave and most enterprising descendants of the Germanic tribe at the time. And it was unthinkable that they would lose their ancestors so quickly and be robbed of their land by a race that was probably superior in barbarity but inferior in number and skill.
By land, it was hindered by the courage and poverty of its neighbors for a while, but the enterprising spirit and overpopulation of the Scandinavian peoples soon found a spout on the sea. Feared before the reign of Emperor Shaareman, they were barely repelled by their vigilance and force during this emperor. But when the empire was in conflict under the Empire's weak successors, they spread like a fiery fire to the Rhine basins, leading to Low Saxony, Friesland, the Netherlands, Flanders, and Ments.
After a long period of desolation of the coastal regions, they entered the center of France, robbed and burned its most beautiful city, imposed enormous tribute to its princes, and finally made one of the finest states of the Kingdom of France. I made it ceded. They terrorized Spain, Italy, and Greece, spreading devastation and horror everywhere. Sometimes they struck comrades as if they wanted to kill each other.

In the old days when Scandinavia was constantly at war and immigrating, few, or perhaps none, were prevented from marrying because of fear of not being able to support their families. In modern Scandinavia, on the contrary, this kind of worry, which is the most pressing and well-founded, constantly hinders marriage. This is especially severe in Norway, as we will see elsewhere later. But the same worries, to a greater or lesser extent, are working with great force everywhere in Europe. Fortunately, the state of the modern world is calmer than before, so it does not require such rapid human supply. Therefore, natural fertility cannot be demonstrated so generally.
Malee says in his excellent account of the northern peoples at the beginning of his "History of Denmaak" that there is no evidence that their migration resulted from a lack of room in their hometown1).

But this kind of case, which may have happened at times, is rare. Due to the daring and migration customs of the time, the entire population may have occasionally moved in search of fertile land. In this case, the land they previously occupied will be uninhabited for some time. And if something particularly unfavorable is on the soil or location, as the total migration of the people shows, it is better to feed oneself with a sword than to immediately occupy such abandoned land. May fit the barbarian temperament. Such total migration proved that societies did not want division, but never proved that they were not in need of place and food in their enemy nations.

However, I do not want to think that the northern peoples never planned an expedition unless prompted by the urgency of food and other circumstances in their homeland.

Asian herders live in tents and portable huts without a fixed dwelling, so their relationship with the land is even weaker than that of the herders in the north of Europe. The hometown of the genuine Tatars is a camp, not the soil. When the grass in an area runs out, the race regularly advances to new rangelands. It travels north in the summer and back south in the winter. Thus, at the most peaceful times, they acquire practical and well-known knowledge about one of the most difficult tasks of war.

Soil generally has a large natural fertility. There are relatively few true deserts. The vague grasslands without shrubs, sometimes referred to as plains and called steps by the Russians, are covered with abundant pasture and are very suitable for ranches of large numbers of livestock and poultry. The main drawback of this vast land is the lack of water. However, in regions with water, it is said that if properly cultivated, it will be enough to feed four times the current number of inhabitants. Every Orda or tribe has a state, each with a summer ranch and a winter ranch. And the population of this vast area, no matter how much, is probably distributed almost in proportion to the actual fertility of each region.

The Bedwien tribes of Arabia and Syria do not live more peacefully than the inhabitants of the Tatars. The very nature of cattle breeding seems to provide a constant opportunity for war. The ranch used by the tribe at one time is only a small part of its property. A vast territory is occupied one after another during the year.

The habit of polygamy probably tends to produce the same result if human life is lost in the war. Niibuul says that polygamy proliferates families until many of their homes sink into their most dire poverty. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right. The descendants of Muhammad are found in great numbers throughout the east, many of them in extreme poverty. Muslims are forced to polygamy to some extent, adhering to the prophet's teaching that one of humans' greatest obligations is to give birth to a child in order to glorify the Creator. Fortunately, as in many other cases, personal interests correct some legislators' absurdity. And the poor Arabs are forced to make their faith proportional to the poverty of their assets. Yet, the direct incentives for population growth are extraordinarily large, and the ineffectiveness and irrationality of such incentives speaks most eloquently to the status quo of these countries. It is universally acknowledged that their population is undoubtedly not large, if not smaller than before, and as a direct result of this, a large increase in one family will absolutely destroy another.

Among the Tatars, who are richer in livestock [# "more"] to live in fertile lands, the prey caught by the looting invasion is higher than in the Arabs. It's big. And because of the superior power of the races, the struggle is more bloody, and the habit of enslavement is common, so more people will be lost in the war. .. Together, these two circumstances allow a lucky robbery group to live in a richer state than their neighbors, who are less daring than their neighbors. Professor Palas specially mentions two wandering races subordinate to Russia, one living almost entirely by looting and the other peaceful to the extent that the disturbing behavior of its neighbors allows.

Those who travel to mugwort in the summer will probably see the vast steps left uninhabited, and the grass is left to savage because there are no livestock to consume it. Let's go. He would probably infer that the region could feed a much larger number of inhabitants, even if the inhabitants were still livestock. But this would be an urgent wrong conclusion. It is said that the power of horses and any other livestock is only proportional to the power of the weakest part of their body. If the legs are thin and weak, the strength of the torso is almost nothing. Or, if the back and hips are not strong, the leg strength that it may have cannot be fully exerted. The same reasoning must be applied to the power to feed living animals. The large amount of food that overflows in the abundant season cannot be consumed in its entirety, depending on the few that have survived the season of deficiency. When human labor and foresight are best guided, the population that the soil can support depends on the average product throughout the year. But in the non-civilized state of animals and humans, the population will be well below this average. It would be very difficult for Tatars to collect and carry enough dead grass to feed all their livestock during the winter months. This could impede their actions, expose themselves to enemy attacks, and, in the event of an unfortunate day, obscure the consequences of all-summer labor. This is because it is common practice to burn off all food and food that cannot be carried away when invading each other. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu Horizontal, line right small writing].

Africa has always been the center of slavery. Thus, the outflow of Africa has a huge and constant population, especially since the adoption of slaves in the European colonies. However, as Dr. Franklin said, it would probably be difficult to find the gap created by the 100-year-old black exports that made America half-black. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, Line right small note]. Despite the constant migration, the loss of many lives due to constant warfare, and the impediment to population growth due to guilt and other causes, the population seems to be constantly pushing the limits of living materials.

When Paak was in Mandin, food shortages caused the poor to suffer very much, which was painfully demonstrated by the following circumstances: Every evening he was there, five or six women came to Mansa's house, each getting some grain.

According to Paak's description, there are many very good lands left uncultivated in Africa, so it may be said that the lack of food is due to the shortage of the people. But if this is the case, we do not know that so many things are sent out of the country every year. What the black peoples really lack is the security of property and its general companion, labor. And without these, population growth would simply aggravate the difficulty. Even assuming that children are given large incentives to fill the seemingly shortage of inhabitants, the consequences are probably increased war, increased slave exports, and a surge in poverty. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-sided writing].

The customs of one ethnic group and the prejudices of all ethnic groups act like this kind of incentive to some extent. According to Bruus, the Black Shangara have little desire for girls, surrounded on all sides by vibrant and powerful enemies, and living with hard labor and constant anxiety. The cause of their polygamy is not on the man's side but on the wife's side. They live in different races and ethnic groups, but these ethnic groups are also divided into families. In the battle, each family attacks and defends independently, and the prey and plunder belong to them. Therefore, the mother knows the disadvantages of the small family and tries to breed the family by doing what she can. And the husband is forced by his wife to accept the request. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. The motives of polygamy in the Oromo are said to be the same, and in both races the first wife asks the second wife to form an alliance with her husband. And the main thing at that time is that both families are tied together and become stronger, and both children are so small that they are no longer prey to the enemy in battle. 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. But perhaps this extreme desire to have a large family fails to reach its goal, and the poverty and poverty it brings is to raise children whose parents are less [# "more"].

Bruus is a great advocate of polygamy, and in the regions where it is widespread, he defends it by claiming that the proportion of births of girls to boys is two to three to one, but this is polygamy. Is the only way to defend. However, such anomalous facts cannot be approved by the vague research that underlies their argument. In such a climate, it is highly likely that there will be significantly more women than men. Even in Europe, where it is certain that more boys will be born than girls, the number of girls is generally higher than that of boys. Therefore, we can imagine that in hot, unhealthy climates and barbaric social conditions, the number of accidents exposed to boys must be very high. Since girls often sit at home, they are less likely to suffer from burning heat and miasma. They will generally be less likely to suffer from illnesses resulting from incontinence. But above all, they will be very immune to the devastation of the war. In the unstoppable social situation of war, the death of a boy due to this cause cannot help causing a great imbalance between the two sexes, but especially the Abyssinian Oromo 1) [# "1)" Tate-chu-yoko, line-right essay], if there is a custom of killing every boy regardless of him and saving only marryable girls from this killing, it must be especially serious. ..

Bruus, with his usual prejudice on this issue, seems to consider the single life of some girls to be fatal to the population of a country.

According to Bruus, food of all kinds is extremely cheap, and in Arabian Felix, where the fruits of human habitual land are native, the cost of having a large number of wives is the same as the number of slaves or It's just as much as the cost of having an employee. Their food is the same, and the blue cotton shirts that are common to all of them are about the same price for everyone. As a result, according to him, singleness of girls is deterred, and the population is increased by polygamy at a rate four times that of monogamy 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right.

It is indisputable that the number of married girls will increase and singleness will be deterred as a result of polygamy. But how much this tends to increase the real population is a very different issue. It will probably continue to squeeze the population tightly by food limits, but the inevitable extreme poverty it brings is by no means favorable to work. And in a climate that seems to have many causes of disease, it is difficult to assume that this state of distress does not significantly contribute to the anomalous mortality found in some of these regions.

If Bruus's depiction of the state of Abyssinia is as close to true as possible, it will fill the population to the standard of living material, even under the overwork of war, epidemics, and orgies. It is a very clear statement of the power of the principle of population growth, which is held in place.
The ethnic groups adjacent to Abyssinia are generally short-lived. According to Bruus, a 22-year-old Shangara woman has more wrinkles and is older than a 60-year-old European girl. .. Therefore, it can be seen that in all these countries, human metabolism is extremely rapid, as is the case with the northern pastoral peoples of the time of constant migration. And the difference between the two cases is that our northern ancestors died outside their own country, but they died in their homeland. If there was an accurate death chart among these ethnic groups, it would be different from the average ratio of 34, 36, or 1 in 40 European countries to the death toll. I have little doubt that at least one in seventeen or eighteen people, including one, will die each year.

Under such climatic and political conditions, a higher degree of foresight, labor, and security will greatly improve their circumstances and increase their population. But if we were to see the births of more children [# "emphasis marks"] without such an adjunct, it would merely aggravate their poverty and the population would still be old. Will stop as it is.
The same can be said for Egypt, which was once prosperous and densely populated. The diminished situation was not caused by the weakening of the principle of population growth, but by the weakening of the principle of labor and foresight due to the insecurity of property as a result of the most violent and oppressive politics. is there. The current principle of population growth in Egypt does what it can. It keeps the population at the standard of living materials. And even if that force is ten times the current actual force, this cannot be more than [# "emphasis mark"].
The purpose is to control large lakes, canals, and Nile rivers, which act as reservoirs for water supply in the year of floods and as drainage ditches and drainage channels to prevent floods in heavy rains. The ruins of ancient construction, such as the large waterways, were once the inhabitants of Egypt striving to fertilize far more land by labor and by the flooding of their rivers, and are now flooding. 1) [# "1)" is a tate-chu-yoko, line-right essay that fully shows that we have made efforts to prevent the plight that is frequently caused by the excess and deficiency of ]. Governor Petronius is said to have done what nature refused by technology, resulting in a good harvest everywhere in Egypt, even at the disadvantage of a lack of flooding, which has always been accompanied by poor harvests 2). [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. Floods that are too large are as deadly to farmers as shortages. As a result, the ancients created drainage channels that flooded the dry sands of Libya with excess water, thus making the desert a habitable place for humans. All of these businesses are now unrepaired, and poor supervision often causes more harm than good. The cause of this negligence, and therefore also the decline in living materials, is clearly the extreme ignorance and brutality of the government and the misery of the people. Mameliuk, who holds the main power, thinks only of his own wealth, and what seems to be the easiest way for this purpose: robbing wealth as soon as it is found, robbing it from its owner with violence, and constantly renewing selfishness. 3) [# "3)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. Their ignorance and brutality, and the constant threat of their lives, do not even give them the idea that wealth is the first step in doing their looting better. So no public works can be expected from the government, and no private wealthy person dares to make any improvements that mean capital ownership, but this is probably an immediate sign of ruin. Because it will be. Under these circumstances, we see that ancient businesses have been neglected, the soil has not been cultivated well, and living materials and therefore also the population has declined significantly. I can't be surprised. But the natural fertility of the Delta due to the flooding of the Nile is significantly higher, so even if no capital is invested in the land, there is no inheritance right, and therefore little property right, it is still large in proportion to its area. Maintaining the population, which gradually improves and expands the country's cultivation and restores it to its former glory, if property is secure and labor is well guided. Is enough. It can be said that it is not the lack of population that hindered the work of Egypt, but the lack of work that hindered the population.

In 1738, the plague << plague >> was very widespread. Also in 1784 and 1785, a terrible famine covered Egypt due to the lack of flooding of the Nile. Bornee makes a surprising depiction of the plight that arose at this time. Shortly after the city of Cairo, which was initially full of beggars, they disappeared altogether, either dying or fleeing. A huge number of unfortunate poor people were scattered in every neighboring country to escape death, and the towns of Syria were flooded with Egyptians.

Chapter 9: Obstacles to the population in North and South Siberia
Residents of the northernmost region of Asia live mainly by hunting and fishing. Therefore, we find that the hindrance to their growth is of the same nature as that among American Indians, but much less hindered by war than in the warmer regions of the United States, and probably more hindered by famine [ # It can be thought that the only difference is that it is large. De Resep, who traveled from Kamchatka to Petersburg with unfortunate Perouse papers, wrote a gruesome sight of the poverty that this region of the world sometimes suffers from food shortages. During his stay in the village of Bolcherek in Kamchatka, he said, "Heavy rains are harmful in the region because they flood and drive fish out of the river. The most painful famine for the poor Kamchatka was the result, which occurred last year in every village on the west coast of the peninsula. This horrific disaster occurs so often in the region that residents are forced to abandon their homes and relocate with their families to the Kamchatka River basin, which is richer in fish. Mr. Kaslov (Russian officer who guided Mr. De Resep) was thinking of going along the west coast, but when he was informed of this famine, he was stuck halfway, contrary to his wishes. Rather than starving to death, I decided to turn back 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing].

Even in the town of Okootsuku, where there is considerable commercial activity, the inhabitants are hungry and waiting for the Okoota River to thaw in the spring.

A huge number of small fish were caught by drying the river water, but the joy and turmoil doubled when I saw this. The most hungry were saved first.

Most of the indigenous peoples of such ruthless regions live almost the same miserable lives, so it would be nothing more than a repetitive statement. From what is said on the right, we are able to fully understand what the main obstacles that are putting pressure on the real population to the level of scarce living materials provided by these rugged regions. Yeah.
Russian travelers say that the soil is extremely fertile in some regions of southern Siberia and in the Volga River basin. It generally consists of black soil that is so fertile that it does not need to be fertilized, or rather is unbearable. Fertilizer simply overgrown the grain, causing it to fall to the ground and rot. The only way to restore the fertility of this type of land is to make it a fallow land once every three years. And if you follow this method, there are some lands that are sober and inexhaustible. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. Moreover, many of these regions are sparsely populated, and in each of these, perhaps the population is expected due to the nature of the soil, with the convenience of such a likely source of the most abundant living resources.

Such a country seems to be under the moral impossibility of increasing, as Saa James Stewaat explains well 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing]. If, due to the nature of politics or the customs of the people, there are obstacles to the development of new farms or the division of old farms, parts of society will be deficient, even in the midst of apparent fertility. You will be worried. It is not enough that a country has the power to produce abundant food, but the state of society must provide a means of its proper distribution. And the reason for the slow population growth in these countries is the fact that the low demand for labor hinders the distribution of soil products, and this distribution of products is the distribution of land. Even if the divisions are still the same, they alone can make the lower classes of society a beneficiary of the rich products of the land. Farming is extremely simple and is said to require few workers. In some places, seeds are simply sprayed on fallow land 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-sided writing]. Soba is a common crop, and it is sown very sparsely, but once sown it lasts for five to six years and produces the first twenty or fifteen times the yield each year.

Agricultural organizations are as follows, and there is little or no industry, so the demand for labor must be met very easily. Grains will undoubtedly be extremely cheap, but labor will be proportionally even cheaper. Farmers may be able to feed their own children a sufficient amount of food, but the wages of their workers will not be enough to comfortably support their families.
If we see a population shortage compared to the fertility of the soil, we give incentives to our children and thus make more [# "more" sidelines] more families. What would be the result if we tried to feed and improve this situation? No one would thus demand the work of an excess of workers brought to the market. Even if one person could buy plenty of food for the day for a pence, none of these would be willing to pay even one farthing for their labor. Farmers can do whatever they want with their own family and one or two workers they have traditionally used, whatever he considers necessary for soil cultivation. Therefore, these things give the farmers nothing they want, so the farmers overcome their sexual laziness, and even bigger and more bones, simply to feed them free of charge. You can't expect to get into a broken job. What should other people do when the very small demand for industrial labor is met in such a situation? In fact, they have no living material at all, as if they lived in a barren desert. They have no choice but to move to a place where the work is demanded, or to die in the extreme of poverty. As a result of their labor being used slightly and only occasionally, they are given poor living materials, which may allow them to survive even if they are spared all the time, but marriage. It is clear that they are incapable of continuing to grow in population.
If the current land and farm divisions were taking place in Europe's most cultivated and most densely populated countries, and commerce and industry were not accompanied by this, then more [# "emphasis marks"] The population would have stopped long ago due to the lack of motivation for the above cultivation and therefore the lack of labor demand. And it is clear that the excessive fertility of the countries discussed here will weigh rather than reduce this difficulty.
If there is a lot of good land that is not used, new settlements and divisions will, of course, take place, as in the United States, and the overpopulation will produce its own food and create demand for it. Perhaps there is something to say.
There is no doubt that it will happen under favorable circumstances. That is, for example, if, firstly, the land has the property of providing raw materials for all other capital as well as grain, secondly, the land can be bought in small lots and the property is free. That is if it is guaranteed under the government, and thirdly, if the habit of labor and accumulation is widespread among the masses. If any of the above conditions are lacking, population growth will be essentially hindered or stopped altogether. Even the richest grain-bearing lands may not be perfectly suitable for vast general settlements due to the lack of trees and water. If farmland lease rights are uncertain or deteriorating, personal accumulation will be the least reluctant and slowest. And under any production convenience, persistent laziness habits and lack of foresight, it would not be possible to bring about a permanent increase and proper distribution of daily necessities.
It is clear that the favorable circumstances listed here do not coexist in Siberia. Political and moral obstacles in the process of rapid population growth can only be guided very slowly, even assuming that there are no physical shortcomings that must be overcome geologically. It can only be overcome by effort. In the United States, the rapid increase in agricultural capital is largely due to the high wages of regular labor. It is believed that a healthy young man needs to be able to free at least £ 340 of gold to start his own planting in the hinterland. In the United States, where there is a great demand for labor and it is paid at a high rate, this amount can be saved in a few years without much difficulty. But overworkers in Siberia collect the money they need to build houses, buy livestock and farm equipment, and live to clean up their new lands and get the right yields. That would be extremely difficult. Even the children of farmers will not find it easy to raise these funds as they grow up. In a social situation where the market for grain is extremely narrow and its prices are very low, growers are always poor. And while they may be able to adequately feed their families with simple food, they cannot make the capital to share with their children and to force them to cultivate new lands. Even if this capital requirement is extremely small, farmers will probably not be able to obtain this small amount. If he makes more grain than usual, he can't find the buyer 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right essay], and then one of the children in the future 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right sutegana]. Therefore, he is often content to grow enough to meet the direct demands of his family and his familiar narrow city baths. And if he had a large family, many of their children would probably fall into the ranks of workers, and as in the case of the workers mentioned above, their further increase would be a lack of living materials.

Therefore, in these countries, what is needed for their population growth is not a direct incentive for the birth and care of children, but an effective demand for soil products by promoting the means of their distribution.

This modest effort, in combination with the past achievements of Piitaa I, had, as expected, had a remarkable effect. And Russia's territory, especially the territory of Asia, which has been asleep for centuries with a population cessation or at best a very slow increase, seems to have suddenly become active in recent years. Although the populations of the more fertile states of Siberia are still quite inadequate compared to their soil abundance, agriculture is not a little prosperous in some of them. And a lot of grains are cultivated. During a common bad harvest in 1996, Isetsk, despite poor harvests, spared all neighboring states from the fear of famine, as well as Ural founders and blacksmiths. 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing].

Many causes outside the right are preventing the Russian colonial population from growing as rapidly as fertility allows. Some of the lowlands of Siberia are unhealthy due to the abundance of swamps. 2) [# "2)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right small writing]. In the regions near the Volga River, the soil is naturally abundant, but droughts occur frequently, so a good harvest more than once every three times is rare. 3) [# "3)" is tate-chu Horizontal, line right small writing].

For safety or convenience purposes, each colonial house is densely or nearly densely built and is not scattered across farms. As a result, there will soon be a shortage of land in the immediate vicinity of the village, and distant land will still be incompletely cultivated. Seeing this fact in the colonies of Kochesnaia, Pallas suggested that the Empress would move some parts to other regions so that the survivors could live more comfortably 5) [#.

This proposal seems to prove that this kind of voluntary division is rare and that the children of the settlers do not always easily settle on their own and support new families.

Therefore, even in such a new colony, it will be found that some of the obstacles to population growth are preventive obstacles.

In a country that is stationary or growing very slowly, no matter how abundant the food may be, it will not be possible to significantly increase the population if all the above-mentioned direct obstacles to the population continue to work. But the undoubted effect of food abundance is to reduce the direct disruptions that have previously been made. However, what remains, either due to the difficulty of changing habits or due to some adverse circumstances of soil or climate, will continue to prevent fertility from exerting its full potential.

Chapter 10: Obstacles to the population in Turkish territory and Persia
It would not be difficult to know the cause of the hindrance to the population and its current decline in the Asian region of Turkey from the description of the tribe. And since the Turkish lifestyles are almost the same whether they live in Europe or Asia, it is not necessary to consider them separately.
There is no doubt that the root cause of Turkey's low population compared to its territorial area is the nature of the government. Its despotism, its weaknesses, its bad laws and its bad operations, combined with the resulting anxiety of property, pose a major obstacle to the process of agriculture, and as a result, living materials inevitably decrease year by year. At the same time, of course, the population is decreasing year by year. The general land tax paid to Milli, or Sultan, is reasonable in itself 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-sided writing]. However, due to the evils of the Turkish government, Pasha and his subordinates have found a way to make Miri a catastrophic tax.

According to Bornee, in Syria, they can free most of the land, so they put harsh conditions on their lending and charge half, or sometimes two-thirds, of the yield. At the end of the harvest, they swear that there is a loss, and because they are in power, they take away as much as they deem appropriate. In case of poor harvest, they still charge the same amount and are forced to sell everything owned by poor farmers. In addition to these constant pressures, there are innumerable untimely exploitations. Sometimes all villages are charged with tribute for de facto or imaginary sins. One-sided gifts are collected for each governor's exchange, pasture, barley and barley straw are required for the governor's horse, and the soldiers who execute the orders sacrifice the starving peasants.

As a natural consequence of such poverty, cultivation techniques are in the most pitiful state. Farmers have few farm tools, and even if they do, they are extremely poor. The hoe is often just a branch cut from under the tree, and is used without a wheelchair. The land is cultivated with donkeys and cows, and rarely with bulls, but this is too luxurious. In regions like Palestine that are exposed to Arab attacks, farmers have to pick up guns and sow, and grain is harvested before it ripens yellow and hidden in underground pits. .. We use as little seed as possible because farmers rarely sow more than they need to survive. Their full work is limited to their direct desire fulfillment.

The highest price is often set as a sign of the total ruin of agriculture, and farmers are forced to offer the grain to the city at a fixed price. Keeping grain prices low in all big cities is an axiom of Turkey's policy, which stems from the weakness of the government and the fear of a mass riot uprising.

The impact of such a political system on agriculture does not require many words. The cause of the decrease in living materials is too obvious. And the impediments that are oppressing the population to such declining resource levels can be traced almost equally reliably, that is, it includes almost all known guilt and poverty.

It is generally said that the Christ family has more children than the Muhammad family, where polygamy is practiced. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right writing]. This is a surprising fact. Although polygamy creates an unequal distribution of girls, which is naturally disadvantageous to the nation's population, individuals who can support a large number of wives are, of course, better than those who have only one wife due to the nature of the matter. Should also have a large number of children. Volnee explains this mainly because it is normal for Turks to become demencia senil at a young age and become infertile at the age of thirty due to the practice of polygamy and very early marriage. 2) [# "2)" is vertical Tate-chu, line right small writing].

The terrifying turmoil that Persia has been suffering from for hundreds of years must have been fatal to the country's agriculture. The period of escape from foreign war and civil war was short and the number was small. And even in a perfect peaceful time, the frontier states were constantly surrendering to the Tatars' overruns.
The result of such a situation is as expected. Saa Jeon Chaadin says that the proportion of uncultivated land in Persia to cultivated land is ten to one. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line right-handed].

Marriage is highly encouraged, and male heirs are of primary importance in the code of the Indian legislator Manu, translated by Saa William Jowns and named the "Hinzu Code." There is.
"By my son, people win over everyone. A person enjoys immortality by his son's son. And later, a man reaches heaven by his grandson's son. 』\

To some extent, such phrases tend to counteract the aforementioned incentives for increase, and if one is a little religious and has one son, he is even more discouraged, or if there is no such decree.

Beyond this strict doctrine of lust control, other circumstances probably prevent the decree that encourages marriage from being fully effective.
Since the people are divided into classes and the mountain family inherits the same profession, this situation gives each individual a clear indication of the future outlook for their livelihood, and in terms of his father's earnings, the same profession. It will be easy to judge whether or not you can support your family. And when they cannot live in a profession suitable for their class, they are allowed to seek a life in another profession under certain restrictions, but relying on this expedient may be accompanied by some shame. Seems to be. And it is unthinkable that many will marry, while thus surely knowing that they must drop out of that class and thus clearly reduce their living conditions. ..
In addition to this, the choice of wife seems to be a very difficult point. Unless the boy is unmarried for quite some time, it will be difficult to find a spouse as prescribed by the legislator. Some families, no matter how wealthy they are and how rich they are in cows, goats, sheep, gold and grains, must strive to avoid them. Daughters with too little or too much hair and daughters who are too talkative are both excluded. And the choice is inevitable: "It has no flaws in its appearance, has a good name, walks gracefully like a fenicopteros or a young elephant, and has moderate hair and teeth in terms of quantity and shape.

Taking all the above circumstances together, it is probable that preventive obstacles are participating in the obstacles to the population in India. But in view of the customs and ideas that are widespread among the people, we believe that the predominance of early marriage is still predominant, and that in general encourages anyone who has any hope of supporting a family to marry. There is a reason to do it. As a corollary to this, the lower class people fell into extreme poverty and were forced to adopt the simplest and rarest way of life. This spartan custom was further increased by being regarded as a remarkable virtue, and extended to the upper class to some extent. 1) [# "1)" is tate-chu-yoko, line-right essay ]. The population would thus be tightly squeezed by the limits of living materials, and the country's food would have been assigned to the majority of the people to the minimum life-sustaining limits. In such a situation, every time there is a poor harvest due to unseasonable seasons, it will be the most severe damage.

For the difficulty of supporting families, even those of the middle and upper classes of society, or for fear of falling out of that class, the local people of India are trying to prevent the birth of a large number of children. In addition, it has come to take extremely cruel measures. It is well documented that some remote races in Junapoor, a region of Varanasi, have a habit of killing girls. The mother was forced to starve them. People cite the reason for such cruel habits as the high cost of getting a suitable spouse for their daughter. There was only one exception to this, but there were several spinsters.
According to this principle, the race cannot be permanent. However, special exceptions to this general principle and marriage to other races were sufficient for the purpose of maintaining the race.

According to Taanaa's description of Nishizo, this kind of custom is more widespread in this country. Mr. Taanaa does not try to give an absolute conclusion to the issue of origin, but hypothesizes that it arose for fear of overpopulation for a stalemate. .. Having traveled extensively to the east, he probably began to observe the inevitable consequences of overpopulation, and as a result he is one of the very few authors to correctly take care of these consequences. It is. He expresses himself very clearly on this issue, but says about the habit on the right: "The overpopulation in a murky country must be the largest of all calamities, and a permanent struggle. Or it is certain to produce a permanent deficiency. If the most active and most capable parts of society migrate and become fateful warriors or lucky merchants, or if they remain in their homeland, they will be in their poor harvest. You must either be forced to prey on famine as a result of an untimely crop failure. By thus tying the entire family together into a bond of marriage, overly rapid population growth can probably be hampered and spread to the most fertile regions of the globe, and the richest in the world. But fear has been prevented, which can cause the most inhumane and most unnatural practices in even the most productive and most densely populated countries.

Boutia is encouraged to stay single and advance to the next stage at the beginning of her life. However, any marriage will almost certainly hinder the advancement of status or promotion to politically important positions.
